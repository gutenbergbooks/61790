<p class='c002'>KATE SANBORN’S BOOKS.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'><b>Abandoning an Adopted Farm.</b>
12mo. Cloth, 75 cents.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Every page is rich with its amusing and entertaining stories
and references.”—<cite>Boston Herald.</cite></p>

<p class='c004'>“Can not fail to be of the utmost interest to any and all who
have spent any time in the country and observed the ways of
country people. Miss Sanborn is simply inimitable in her ability
to catch the humorous in what is passing about her, and in setting
it down so that others can enjoy it.”—<cite>Cleveland World.</cite></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'><b>Adopting an Abandoned Farm.</b>
16mo. Boards, 50 cents.</p>

<p class='c002'>“‘Adopting an Abandoned Farm’ has as much laugh to the
square inch as any book we have read this many a day.”—<cite>Boston
Sunday Herald.</cite></p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Kate Sanborn has made a name and place for herself
beside the immortal Sam Slick, and has made Gooseville, Connecticut,
as illustrious as Slickville in Onion County, of the same
State.”—<cite>The Critic.</cite></p>

<p class='c004'>“If any one wants an hour’s entertainment for a warm sunny
day on the piazza, or a cold wet day by a log fire, this is the
book that will furnish it.”—<cite>New York Observer.</cite></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'><b>A Truthful Woman in Southern
California.</b> 12mo. Cloth, 75 cents.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Miss Sanborn is certainly a very bright writer, and when a
book bears her name it is safe to buy it and put it aside for delectation
when a leisure hour comes along. This bit of a volume
is enticing in every page, and the weather seemed not to be so
intolerably hot while we were reading it.”—<cite>New York Herald.</cite></p>

<p class='c004'>“Her descriptions are inimitable, and their brilliancy is enhanced
with quaint and witty observations and brief historical
allusions.... Valuable information and richly entertaining descriptions
are admirably blended in this book.”—<cite>Boston Home
Journal.</cite></p>

  <h2 class='c008'>EVERYBODY’S PETS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The world’s not seen him yet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who has not loved a pet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Not the human pets of noted persons,
such as Walter Scott’s Pet Marjorie,
that winsome, precocious little
witch, so loved by the “Wizard of the
North,” or Bettina von Arnim, the
eccentric, brilliant girl, whose rhapsodic
idolatry was placidly encouraged
by the great Goethe, but the
dumb favourites of distinguished men
and women.</p>

<p class='c004'>I must devote a few pages to the
various tributes to insects, birds, and
animals, written about with love, pity,
or admiration, yet not as pets, as Burns’s
address to the Mousie:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I’m truly sorry man’s dominion</div>
      <div class='line'>Has broken Nature’s social union,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>And justifies that ill opinion,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Which makes thee startle</div>
      <div class='line'>At me, thy poor earth-born companion</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And fellow-mortal;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and another to an unspeakable insect
that rhymes with mouse. We remember,
too, his essay on Inhuman Man,
as he saw a wounded hare limp by.
The fly has often been honoured in
prose or verse, but we all like best the
benevolent speech of dear Uncle Toby
in Tristram Shandy to the overgrown
bluebottle, which had buzzed about
his nose and tormented him cruelly
during dinner, and which, after infinite
attempts, he had caught at last.
“I’ll not hurt thee,” said Uncle Toby;
“I’ll not hurt a hair of thy head.
Go,” said he, lifting up the window—“go,
poor devil, get thee gone. Why
should I hurt thee? This world surely
is wide enough to hold both thee
and me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tristram adds, “The lesson then imprinted
has never since been an hour
out of mind, and I often think that I
owe one half of my philanthropy to
that one accidental impression.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Greek grasshopper must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>been a wonderful creature, a sacred
object, and spoken of as a charming
songster. When Socrates and Phædrus
came to the fountain shaded by
the palm tree, where they had their
famous discourse, Socrates spoke of
“the choir of grasshoppers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Another makes the insect say to a
rustic who had captured him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Me, the Nymphs’ wayside minstrel, whose sweet note</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er sultry hill is heard, and shady grove to float.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Still another sings how a grasshopper
took the place of a broken string
on his lyre and “filled the cadence
due.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This Pindaric grasshopper seems
quite unlike the ravaging locust of
the West. Burroughs suggests that
he should be brought to our country,
as some one is trying to introduce the
English lark.</p>

<p class='c004'>Emerson devotes a poem to the
burly dozing bumblebee, a genuine
optimist:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wiser far than human seer,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yellow-breeched philosopher;</div>
      <div class='line'>Seeing only what is fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sipping only what is sweet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>A delightful volume could be compiled
on the literature of bird life,
from the cuckoo, the earliest songster
honoured by the poets, to Matthew
Arnold’s canary. Passing on to animals,
the Lake poets were interested
to a noticeable degree in these humble
companions. In Peter Bell, a poem
that proved Wordsworth’s theories
about poetry to be untenable, the ass
is the hero, a veritable preacher, as in
the days of Balaam. And Coleridge,
greatly to the amusement of his critics,
addressed some lines To a Young
Ass, its Mother being tethered near it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How askingly its footsteps hither tend!</div>
      <div class='line'>It seems to say, And have I then one friend?</div>
      <div class='line'>Innocent foal! thou poor despised forlorn!</div>
      <div class='line'>I hail thee brother, spite of the fool’s scorn!</div>
      <div class='line'>And fain would take thee with me, in the dell</div>
      <div class='line'>Of peace and mild equality to dwell.</div>
      <div class='line'>Where Toil shall call the charmer Health his bride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Laughter tickle Plenty’s ribless side!</div>
      <div class='line'>How thou wouldst toss thy heels in gamesome play,</div>
      <div class='line'>And frisk about as lamb or kitten gay!</div>
      <div class='line'>Yea! and more musically sweet to me</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy dissonant harsh bray of joy would be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than warbled melodies that soothe to rest</div>
      <div class='line'>The aching of pale fashion’s vacant breast.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Wordsworth also wrote on The
White Doe of Rylstone and The
Pet Lamb.</p>

<p class='c004'>Southey paid his respects to The
Pig and a Dancing Bear:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Alas, poor Bruin! How he foots the pole,</div>
      <div class='line'>And waddles round it with unwieldy steps</div>
      <div class='line'>Swaying from side to side. The dancing master</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath had as profitless a pupil in him</div>
      <div class='line'>As when he tortured my poor toes</div>
      <div class='line'>To minuet grace, and made them move like clock-work</div>
      <div class='line'>In musical obedience.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>After sympathizing with his “piteous
plight” he draws a moral for the advocates
of the slave trade.</p>

<p class='c004'>He also addressed poems to The Bee
and A Spider; the latter must be given
entire, it is so strong and original in its
comparisons:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Spider! thou needst not run in fear about</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To shun my curious eyes;</div>
      <div class='line'>I won’t humanely crush thy bowels out</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Lest thou should eat the flies;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor will I roast thee with a damned delight,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thy strange instinctive fortitude to see,</div>
      <div class='line'>For there is One who might</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One day roast me.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Weaver of snares, thou emblemest the ways</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of Satan, sire of lies;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hell’s huge black spider, for mankind he lays</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His toils, as thou for flies.</div>

<p class='c004'>Cackling geese saved Rome, and Caligula
shod his favourite horse with gold
and nominated him for vice consul, as
he considered him vastly superior to
the men who aspired to that honourable
position. Virgil amused his leisure
hours with a gnat. Homer made
pets of frogs and mice.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>The horse has been dearly loved by
many famous people who have not
been ashamed to own it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Everett once told a pathetic anecdote
of Edmund Burke, that “in the
decline of his life, when living in retirement
on his farm at Beaconsfield,
the rumour went up to London that
he had gone mad and went round his
park kissing his cows and horses. His
only son had died not long before,
leaving a petted horse which had been
turned into the park and treated as a
privileged favourite. Mr. Burke in his
morning walks would often stop to
caress the favourite animal. On one
occasion the horse recognised Mr.
Burke from a distance, and coming
nearer and nearer, eyed him with the
most pleading look of recognition, and
said as plainly as words could have
said, ‘I have lost him too!’ and then
the poor dumb beast deliberately laid
his head upon Mr. Burke’s bosom.
Overwhelmed by the tenderness of
the animal, expressed in the mute eloquence
of holy Nature’s universal language,
the illustrious statesman for a
moment lost his self-possession and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>clasping his arms around his son’s favourite
animal, lifted up that voice
which had caused the arches of Westminster
Hall to echo the noblest strains
that sounded within them, and wept
aloud. Burke is gone; but, sir, so
hold me Heaven, if I were called
upon to designate the event or the
period in Burke’s life that would best
sustain a charge of insanity, it would
not be when, in a gush of the holiest
and purest feeling that ever stirred
the human heart, he wept aloud on the
neck of a dead son’s favourite horse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Erskine composed some lines

<p class='c004'>Bayard Taylor loved and appreciated
animals, and in an article in the
Atlantic Monthly of February, 1877,
on Studies of Animal Nature, he says:
“If Darwin’s theory should be true,
it will not degrade man; it will simply
raise the whole animal world into
dignity, leaving man as far in advance
as he is at present.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>He adds: “I have always had a
great respect for animals, and have
endeavoured to treat them with the
consideration which I think they deserve.
They have quick perceptions,
and know when to be confiding or
reticent. I have learned no better
way to gain their confidence than to
ask myself, If I were such or such an
animal, how should I wish to be treated
by man? and to act upon that suggestion.
Since the key to the separate
languages has been lost on both sides,
the higher intelligence must condescend
to open some means of communication
with the lower.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The zoölogists unfortunately rarely
trouble themselves to do this; they
are more interested in the skull of an
elephant, the thigh-bone of a bird, or
the dorsal fin of a fish, than in the intelligence
or rudimentary moral sense
of the creature. But the former field
is open to all laymen, and nothing but
a stubborn traditional contempt for
our slaves or our hunted enemies in
the animal world has held us back
from a truer knowledge of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the first place, animals have much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>more capacity to understand human
speech than is generally supposed.
Some years ago, seeing the hippopotamus
in Barnum’s Museum looking
very stolid and dejected, I spoke
to him in English, but he did not even
move his eyes. Then I went to the
opposite corner of the cage and said
in Arabic: ‘I know you; come here
to me.’ He instantly turned his head
toward me. I repeated the words,
and thereupon he came to the corner
where I was standing, pressed his
huge, ungainly head against the bars
of the cage, and looked in my face
with a touching delight while I
stroked his muzzle. I have two or
three times found a lion who recognised
the same language, and the expression
of his eyes for an instant
seemed positively human.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He also tells his experience with a
tame lioness in Africa. “In a short
time we were very good friends. She
knew me, and always seemed glad to
see me, though I sometimes teased
her a little by getting astride of her
back, or sitting upon her when she
was lying down. When she was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>a playful mood she would come to
meet me as far as the rope would
let her, get her forepaws around my
leg and then take it in her mouth, as
if she were going to eat me up. I was
a little alarmed when she did this for
the first time; but I soon saw that she
was merely in play, and had no thought
of hurting me, so I took her by the
ears and slapped her sides, until at last
she lay down and licked my hand.
Her tongue was as coarse as a nutmeg
grater, and my hand felt as if the
skin was being rasped off.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There was also a leopard in the
garden with which I used to play a
great deal, but which I never loved
so well as the lioness. He was smaller
and more active, and soon learned to
jump upon my shoulders when I
stooped down, or to climb up the
tree to which he was tied, whenever
I commanded him. But he was not
so affectionate as the lioness, and
sometimes forgot to draw in his claws
when he played, so that he not only
tore my clothing, but scratched my
hands. I still have the marks of one of
his teeth on the back of my right hand.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“My old lioness was never rough,
and I have frequently, when she had
stretched out to take a nap, sat upon
her back for half an hour at a time,
smoking my pipe or reading.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I assure you I was very sorry to
part with her, and when I saw her for
the last time one moonlight night, I
gave her a good hug and an affectionate
kiss. She would have kissed me
back if her mouth had not been too
large; but she licked my hand to
show that she loved me, then laid her
big head upon the ground and went
to sleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dear old lioness! I wonder if
you ever think of me. I wonder if
you would know me, should we ever
see each other again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>If our late minister to Berlin, the
accomplished poet, linguist, and cosmopolitan,
could give his attention to
animals as friends and companions,
there can be nothing belittling in
reading their praises as said or sung
by those whom we all delight to
honour.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hamerton, indeed, makes a comparison
in which we come out but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>second best. He says: “How much
weariness has there been in the human
race during the last fifty years,
because the human race can not stop
politically where it was, and, finding
no rest, is pushed to a strange future
that the wisest look forward to gravely,
as certainly very dark and probably
very dangerous! Meanwhile,
have the bees suffered any political
uneasiness? have they doubted the
use of royalty or begrudged the cost
of their queen? Have those industrious
republicans, the ants, gone about
uneasily seeking after a sovereign?
Has the eagle grown weary of his
isolation and sought strength in the
practice of socialism? Has the dog
become too enlightened to endure
any longer his position as man’s humble
friend, and contemplated a canine
union for mutual protection against
masters? No; the great principles
of these existences are superior to
change, and that which man is perpetually
seeking—a political order in
perfect harmony with his condition—the
brute has inherited with his instincts.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Cowper, in The Task, devotes several
pages to the proper treatment of
animals, and expresses his admiration
for their many noble qualities:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'>Accountable; and God some future day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will reckon with us roundly for the abuse</div>
      <div class='line'>Of what he deems no mean or trivial trust.</div>
      <div class='line'>Superior as we are, they yet depend</div>
      <div class='line'>Not more on human help than we on theirs.</div>
      <div class='line'>Their strength, or speed, or vigilance, were given</div>
      <div class='line'>In aid of our defects. In some are found</div>
      <div class='line'>Such teachable and apprehensive parts,</div>
      <div class='line'>That man’s attainments in his own concerns,</div>
      <div class='line'>Matched with the expertness of the brutes in theirs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are ofttimes vanquished and thrown far behind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some show that nice sagacity of smell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And read with such discernment, in the port</div>
      <div class='line'>And figure of the man, his secret aim,</div>
      <div class='line'>That oft we owe our safety to a skill</div>

faults. Heaven has accorded this to us in the uncritical
canine attachment.—<span class='sc'>George Eliot.</span></p>

<p class='c002'>Literature, history, and biography
are full to overflowing of instances
of affection between dogs and
their owners. Remember the dog
Argus, which died of joy on the return
of his master Ulysses after twenty
years’ absence. The story is touchingly
told in Homer’s Odyssey:</p>

<p class='c004'>“As he draws near the gates of his
own palace, he espies, dying of old
age, disease, and neglect, his dog Argus—the
companion of many a long
chase in happier days. His instinct
at once detects his old master, even
through the disguise lent by the goddess
of wisdom. Before he sees him
he knows his voice and step, and raises
his ears—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>And when he marked Odysseus in the way,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And could no longer to his lord come near,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fawned with his tail and drooped in feeble play</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His ears. Odysseus, turning, wiped a tear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is poor Argus’s last effort, and the
old hound turns and dies—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Just having seen Odysseus in the twentieth year.</div>
    </div>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Egyptians held the dog in adoration
as the representative of one of
the celestial signs, and the Indians
considered him one of the sacred
forms of their deities. The dog is
placed at the feet of women in monuments,
to symbolize affection and fidelity;
and many of the Crusaders are
represented with their feet on a dog,
to show that they followed the standard
of the Lord as a dog follows the
footsteps of his master. “Man,” said
Burns, “is the god of the dog”—knows
nothing higher to reverence
and obey. Kings and queens have
found their most faithful friends
among dogs. Frederick the Great
allowed his elegant furniture at Potsdam
to be nearly ruined by his dogs,
who jumped upon the satin chairs and
slept cosily on the luxurious sofas, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>quite a cemetery may still be seen devoted
to his pets. The pretty spaniel
belonging to Mary Queen of Scots deserves
honourable mention. He loved
his ill-starred mistress when her human
friends had forsaken her; nestled
close by her side at the execution,
and had to be forced away from her
bleeding body. One of the prettiest
pictures of the Princess of Wales is
taken with a tiny spaniel in her arms.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before going further, just recall
some of the most famous dogs of

<p class='c004'>The famous Mount St. Bernard dog,
which saved forty human beings, was
named Barry. His stuffed skin is preserved
in the museum at Berne.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Isaac Newton’s dog, who by
overturning a candle destroyed much
precious manuscript, was named Diamond.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ancient Xantippus caused his
dog to be interred on an eminence
near the sea, which has ever since retained
his name, Cynossema. There
are even legends of nations that have
had a dog for their king. It is said
that barking is not a natural faculty,
but is acquired through the dog’s desire
to talk with man. In a state of
nature, dogs simply whine and howl.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Alexander encountered Diogĕnês
the cynic, the young Macedonian
king introduced himself with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>words, “I am Alexander, surnamed
‘the Great.’” To which the philosopher
replied, “And I am Diogĕnês,
surnamed ‘the Dog.’” The Athenians
raised to his memory a pillar of Parian
marble, surmounted with a dog, and
bearing the following inscription:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“Say, dog, what guard you in that tomb?”</div>
      <div class='line'>A dog. “His name?” Diogĕnês. “From far?”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sinopé. “He who made a tub his home?”</div>
      <div class='line'>The same; now dead, among the stars a star.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>What man or woman worth remembering
but has loved at least one dog?
Hamerton, in speaking of the one dog—the
 special pet and dear companion
of every boy and many a girl, from
Ulysses to Bismarck—observes that
“the comparative shortness of the
lives of dogs is the only imperfection
in the relation between them and
us. If they had lived to threescore
and ten, man and dog might have travelled
through life together; but as it
is, we must have either a succession
of affections, or else, when the first is
buried in its early grave, live in a chill
condition of dog-lessness.” I thank
him for coining that compound word.
Almost every one might, like Grace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Greenwood and Gautier, write a History
of my Pets, and make a most
readable book. Bismarck honoured
one of his dogs, Nero, with a formal
funeral. The body was borne on the
shoulders of eight workmen dressed
in black to a grave in the park. He
had been poisoned, and a large reward
was offered for the discovery of
the assassin. The prince, statesman,
diplomatist, does not believe in dog-lessness,
and gives to another hound,
equally devoted, the same intense affection.
“My dog—where is my
dog?” are his first words on alighting
from a railway, as Sultan must
travel second class. He even mixes
the food for his dogs with his own
hands, believing it will make them
love him the more.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another Nero was the special companion
of Mrs. Carlyle, a little white
dog, who had for his playmate a black
cat, whose name was Columbine, and
Carlyle says that during breakfast,
whenever the dining-room door was
opened, Nero and Columbine would
come waltzing into the room in the
height of joy. He went with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>mistress everywhere, led by a chain
for fear of thieves. For eleven years
he cheered her life at Craigenputtock,
“the loneliest nook in Britain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nero’s death was a tragical one. In
October, 1859, while walking out with
the maid one evening, a butcher’s cart
driving furiously round a sharp corner
ran over his throat. He was not killed
on the spot, although his mistress says
“he looked killed enough at first.” The
poor fellow was put into a warm bath,
wrapped up in flannels, and left to die.
The morning found him better, however;
he was able to wag his tail
in response to the caresses of his mistress.</p>

<p class='c004'>Little by little he recovered the use
of himself, but it was ten days before
he could bark.</p>

<p class='c004'>He lived four months after this,
docile, affectionate, loyal up to his
last hour, but weak and full of pain.
The doctor was obliged at last to give
him prussic acid. They buried him at
the top of the garden in Cheyne Row,
and planted cowslips round his grave,
and his loving mistress placed a stone
tablet, with name and date, to mark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the last resting place of her blessed
dog.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I could not have believed,” writes
Carlyle in the Memorials, “my grief
then and since would have been the
twentieth part of what it was—nay,
that the want of him would have been
to me other than a riddance. Our last
midnight walk together—for he insisted
on trying to come—January 31st, is
still painful to my thought. Little dim
white speck of life, of love, fidelity, and
feeling, girdled by the darkness of night
eternal.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Is not that a delightful revelation of
tenderness in the heart of the grand old
growler, biographer, critic, historian,
essayist, prophet, whom most people
feared? I like to read it again and again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The selfish, cynical Horace Walpole
sat up night after night with his dying
Rosette. He wrote: “Poor Rosette
has suffered exquisitely; you may believe
I have too,” and honoured her
with this epitaph:</p>

<p class='c004'>And of the dog Touton, left him by
Madame du Deffand, he said: “It is
incredible how fond I am of it; but I
have no occasion to brag of my <em>dogmanity</em>”
(another expressive word). He
said, “A dog, though a flatterer, is still
a friend.” Byron, that egotistic, misanthropic
genius, composed an epitaph
on Boatswain, his favourite dog, whose
death threw the moody poet into deepest
melancholy. The dog’s grave is to
the present day shown among the conspicuous
objects at Newstead. The
poet, in one of his impulsive moments,
gave orders in a provision of his will—ultimately
however, cancelled—that
his own body should be buried by the
side of Boatswain, as his truest and
only friend. This noble animal was
seized with madness, and so little was
his lordship aware of the fact, that at
the beginning of the attack he more
than once, during the paroxysms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>wiped away the dreaded saliva from
his mouth. After his death Lord Byron
wrote to his friend Mr. Hodges:
“Boatswain is dead. He died in a
state of madness on the 18th, after suffering
much, yet retaining all the gentleness
of his nature to the last, never
attempting to do the least injury to
any one near him. I have now lost
everything excepting old Murray.”
Visitors to his old estate will find a
marked monument with this tribute:</p>

<p class='c004'>Walter Scott’s dogs had an extraordinary
fondness for him. Swanston
declares that he had to stand by, when
they were leaping and fawning about
him, to beat them off lest they should
knock him down. One day, when he
and Swanston were in the armory,
Maida (the dog which now lies at
his feet in the monument at Edinburgh),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>being outside, had peeped in
through the window, a beautifully
painted one, and the instant she got
a glance of her beloved master she
bolted right through it and at him.
Lady Scott, starting at the crash, exclaimed,
“O gracious, shoot her!”
But Scott, caressing her with the utmost
coolness, said, “No, no, mamma,
though she were to break every window
at Abbotsford.” He was engaged
for an important dinner party
on the day his dog Camp died, but
sent word that he could not go, “on
account of the death of a dear old
friend.” He tried early one morning
to make the fire of peat burn,
and after many efforts succeeded in
some degree. At this moment one of
the dogs, dripping from a plunge in
the lake, scratched and whined at the
window. Sir Walter let the “puir
creature” in, who, coming up before
the little fire, shook his shaggy hide,
sending a perfect shower bath over
the fire and over a great table of loose
manuscripts. The tender-hearted author,
eying the scene with his usual
serenity, said slowly, “O dear, ye’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>done a great deal of mischief!” This
equanimity is only equalled by Sir
Isaac Newton’s exclamation, now,
alas! pronounced a fiction, “O Diamond,
Diamond, little dost thou know
the injury thou hast done!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The wisest dog I ever had,” said
Scott, “was what is called the bulldog
terrier. I taught him to understand
a great many words, insomuch
that I am positive that the communication
betwixt the canine species
and ourselves might be greatly enlarged.
Camp once bit the baker who
was bringing bread to the family. I
beat him and explained the enormity
of the offence, after which, to the last
moment of his life, he never heard the
least allusion to the story, in whatever
voice or tone it was mentioned, without
getting up and retiring to the
darkest corner of the room with great
appearance of distress. Then if you
said, ‘The baker was well paid,’ or ‘The
baker was not hurt, after all,’ Camp
came forth from his hiding place, capered
and barked and rejoiced. When
he was unable, toward the end of his
life, to attend me when on horseback,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>he used to watch for my return, and
the servant would tell him ‘his master
was coming down the hill’ or
‘through the moor,’ and, although he
did not use any gesture to explain his
meaning, Camp was never known to
mistake him, but either went out at
the front to go up the hill or at the
back to get down to the moorside.
He certainly had a singular knowledge
of spoken language.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Once when the great novelist was
sitting for his picture he exclaimed,
“I am as tired of the operation as old
Maida, who has been so often sketched
that he got up and walked off with
signs of loathing whenever he saw an
artist unfurl his paper and handle his
brushes!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It is well known that a dog instantly
discerns a friend from an enemy; in
fact, he seems to know all those who
are friendly to his race. There are
few things more touching in the life
of this great man than the fact that,
when he walked in the streets of
Edinburgh, nearly every dog he met
came and fawned on him, wagged
his tail at him, and thus showed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>his recognition of the friend of his
race.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>Àpropos</em> of understanding what is
said to them, Bayard Taylor says,
“I know of nothing more moving,
indeed semi-tragic, than the yearning
helplessness in the face of a dog who
understands what is said to him and
can not answer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Walter Savage Landor, irascible,
conceited, tempestuous, had a deep
affection for dogs, as well as all other
dumb creatures, that was interesting.
“Of all the Louis Quatorze rhymesters
I tolerate La Fontaine only, for
I never see an animal, unless it be a
parrot, a monkey, or a pug dog, or a
serpent, that I do not converse with
it either openly or secretly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The story of the noble martyr Gellert,
who risked his own life for his
master’s child, only to be suspected
and slain by the hand he loved so
well, is perhaps too familiar to be repeated,
and yet I can not resist Spenser’s
version:</p>

<p class='c004'>The huntsman missed his faithful
hound; he did not respond to horn or
cry. But at last as Llewelyn “homeward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>hied” the dog bounded to greet
him, smeared with gore. On entering
the house he found his child’s couch
also stained with blood, and the infant
nowhere to be seen. Believing Gellert
had devoured the boy, he plunged
his sword in his side, but soon discovered
the cherub alive and rosy, while
beneath the couch, gaunt and tremendous,
a wolf torn and killed:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Dr. John Brown’s exquisite prose
poem of Rab and his Friends is as
lasting a memorial to that dog as any
built of granite or marble. The dog
is emphatically the central figure, the
hero of the story. The author sat for
his picture with Rab by his side, and
we are told that his interest in a half-blind
and aged pet was evinced in the
very last hours of his life. The dog
has figured as the real attraction in
several novels, and Ouida lets Puck
tell his own story. Mrs. Stowe devoted
one volume to Stories about our
Dogs, and wrote also A Dog’s Mission.

<p class='c004'>Miss Cobbe is a devoted, outspoken
friend of all animals. She says: “I
have, indeed, always felt much affection
for dogs—that is to say, for those
who exhibit the true dog character,
which is far from being the case with
every canine creature. Their sageness,
their joyousness, their transparent
little wiles, their caressing and devoted
affection, are to me more winning—even,
I may say, more really
and intensely <em>human</em> (in the sense in
which a child is human)—than the
artificial, cold, and selfish characters
one meets too often in the guise of
ladies and gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She had a fluffy white dog she was
extremely fond of, and has written several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>chapters on dogs, kindness to animals,
the horrors of vivisection, etc.
Read False Hearts and True, The
Confessions of a Lost Dog, and Science
in Excelsis, and you will realize
how she appreciates the rights and the
noble traits of the brute creation, and
how her own great heart has gone out
to her pets. She closes one article,
Dogs whom I have Met, with these
words: “One thing I think must be
clear: until a man has learned to feel
for all his sentient fellow-creatures,
whether in human or in brute form,
of his own class and sex and country,
or of another, he has not yet ascended
the first step toward true civilization,
nor applied the first lesson from the
love of God.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Edward Jesse, in his book, now rare
and hard to obtain, on dogs, says,
“Histories are more full of samples
of the fidelity of dogs than of friends.”
A French writer declares that, excepting
women, there is nothing on earth
so agreeable or so necessary to the
comfort of man as the dog. Think of
the shepherd, his flock collected by
his indefatigable dog, who guards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>both them and his master’s cottage
at night; satisfied with a slight caress
and coarsest food. The dog performs
the service of a horse in more northern
regions, while in Cuba and other
hot countries is the terror of the runaway
negroes. In destruction of wild
beasts or the less dangerous stag, or
in attacking the bull, the dog has
shown permanent courage. He defends
his master, saves from drowning,
warns of danger, serves faithfully
in poverty and distress, leads the blind.
When spoken to, does his best to hold
conversation by tail, eyes, ears; drives
cattle to and from pasture, keeps herds
and flocks within bounds, points out
game, brings shot birds, turns a spit,
draws provision carts and sledges,
likes or abhors music, detecting false
notes instantly; announces strangers,
sounds a note of warning in danger,
is the last to forsake the grave of a
friend, sympathizes and rejoices with
every mood of his master. The collie
is the only dog who has a reputation
for piety, his liking to go to kirk
and his proper behaviour there being
well known. Whenever Stanislaus, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>unfortunate King of Poland, wrote to
his daughter, he always concluded
with “Tristram, my companion in
misfortune, licks your feet.” That
one friend stuck by in his adversity.
We see inherited tendencies in dogs
as in children—what Paley calls “a
propensity previous to experience and
independent of instruction”—as Saint
Bernard puppies scratching eagerly
at snow, and young pointers standing
steadily on first seeing poultry; a
well-bred terrier pup will show ferocity.
The anecdotes of achievements
of pet dogs are marvellous.
Leibnitz related to the French Academy
an account of a dog he had seen
which was taught to speak, and would
call intelligibly for tea, coffee, chocolate,
and made collections of white,
shining stones.</p>

<p class='c004'>We read of dogs who know when
Sunday comes; who watch for the
butcher’s cart only at his stated time
for appearance; who will beg for a
penny to buy a pie or bun, and then
go to the baker’s and purchase; who
exercise forethought and providence,
burying bones for future need. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>seem to have some moral sense,
ashamed of stealing, sometimes making
retribution, scolding puppies for
stealing meat; others are as depraved
as human beings, slipping their collars
and undoing the collar of another dog
to go marauding, then returning, put
their heads back into the collar.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Darwin said, “Since publishing The Descent of
Man I have got to believe rather more than I did in
dogs having what may be called a <em>conscience</em>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Landseer’s dogs used to pose for
him with more patience than many
other sitters. Some one said of him
that he had “discovered the dog.”
He was so devoted to them that when
the wittiest of divines and divinest of
wits (of course I mean Sydney Smith)
was asked to sit to him, he replied,
“‘Is thy servant a dog, that he should
do this thing?’” The artist spoke of
a Newfoundland who had saved many
from drowning as “a distinguished
member of the Humane Society.”
Hamerton, in his charming Chapters
on Animals, tells us stories, almost too
wonderful for belief, of some French
poodles who came to visit him. These
canine guests played dominoes, sulked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>when they had to draw from the bank,
retired mortified when beaten; also
played cards, were skilful spellers in
several languages, and quick in arithmetic.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each breed has its own defenders
and adherents. Olive Thorne Miller
usually writes of birds or odd pets;
but in Home Pets we find a most interesting
tale of a collie, which she
gives, to illustrate the characteristics
of that family:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nearly one hundred and fifty years
ago, in the early days of our nation
and during the French and Indian
War, this collie was a great pet in
the family of a colonial soldier, and
was particularly noted for his antipathy
to Indians, whom he delighted to
track. On one campaign against the
French the dog insisted on accompanying
his master, although his feet
were in a terrible condition, having
been frozen. During the fight, which
ended in the famous Braddock’s defeat,
the collie was beside his master,
but when it was over they had become
separated, and the soldier, concluding
that his pet had been killed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>went home without him. Some weeks
after, however, the dog appeared in
his old home, separated from the battlefield
by many miles and thick forests.
He was tired and worn, but
over his feet were fastened neat moccasins,
showing that he had been
among Indians, who had been kind
to him. Moreover, he soon showed
that he had changed his mind about
his former foe, for neither bribes nor
threats could ever induce him to track
an Indian. His generous nature could
not forget a kindness, even to please
those he loved enough to seek under
so great difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This reminds me of several dog
stories.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following interesting letter is
published in the London Spectator:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Being accustomed to walk out before
breakfast with two Skye terriers,
it was my custom to wash their feet
in a tub, kept for the purpose in the
garden, whenever the weather was
wet. One morning, when I took up
the dog to carry him to the tub he bit
me so severely that I was obliged to
let him go. No sooner was the dog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>at liberty than he ran down to the
kitchen and hid himself. For three
days he refused food, declined to go
out with any of the family, and appeared
very dejected, with a distressed
and unusual expression of
countenance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“On the third morning, however,
upon returning with the other dog, I
found him sitting by the tub, and
upon coming toward him he immediately
jumped into it and sat down in
the water. After pretending to wash
his legs, he jumped out as happy as
possible, and from that moment recovered
his usual spirits.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There appears in this instance to
have been a clear process of reasoning,
accompanied by acute feeling,
going on in the dog’s mind from the
moment he bit me until he hit upon
a plan of showing his regret and
making reparation for his fault. It
evidently occurred to him that I
attached great importance to this
footbath, and if he could convince
me that his contrition was sincere,
and that he was willing to submit to
the process without a murmur, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>should be satisfied. The dog, in this
case, reasoned with perfect accuracy,
and from his own premises deduced a
legitimate conclusion which the result
justified.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I like to read of the dog who waited
on the town clerk of Amesbury for
his license. “The possessor of the dog
in question is red-headed George
Morrill, and red-headed George Morrills
never (hardly ever) lie, and from
him we learn the following facts: It
appears that Mr. Morrill, who was
busy at the time, and desired to have
his pet properly licensed, wrote on
a slip of paper as follows: ‘Mr. Collins,
please give me my license.
Charlie.’ Inclosing this, with two
dollars, in an envelope, he gave it
to the dog, telling him to go to Mr.
Collins and get his license. On arriving
at the town clerk’s office he
found Mr. Collins busy, and being a
well-bred dog waited until the gentleman
was at liberty, when he made his
presence known. Mr. Collins, observing
the envelope in his mouth, took it,
and immediately the dog assumed a
sitting posture, remaining thus until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the officer made out the proper
license, and, inclosing this in an envelope,
handed it to his dogship, who
instantly raised himself to his full
length, making a bow with his head,
and, coming down to his natural position,
wagged his tail satisfactorily
and departed for home. The dog is
well known on the street for his sagacity
and intelligence, but this has
rather capped any of his previous
performances.”</p>

<p class='c002'>One of the best stories about the intelligence
of dogs which has been told
for some time was repeated a few days
ago by an officer of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company. He said that one
of the men in the passenger department
had a dog that could tell the
time of day. The owner of the dog
had a fine clock in his office, and he
got into the habit of making the dog
tap with his paw at each stroke of the
clock. After a while the dog did so
without being told, and as the clock
gave a little cluck just before striking,
the dog would get into position, prick
up his ears, and tap out the time. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the clock had struck one and a little
while afterward his owner imitated
the preliminary cluck of the clock,
the dog would give two taps with his
paw, and so on for any hour. He
knew just how the hours ran and how
many taps to give for each one.</p>

<p class='c004'>We must of course believe a clergyman’s
story of a dog, the Rev. C. J.
Adams, in The Dog Fancier:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not ‘Tige,’ concerning whom I
have told a number of stories in this
department. Tiger is another dog,
and a fine fellow he is. His hair is
short, and he is as black as night. I
have met him but once, and that was
at a clericus at the house of his master—the
Rev. Peter Claude Creveling,
at Cornwall, N. Y. He is probably
four feet and a half long as to his
body. He stands nearly as high as
an ordinary table. He has a fine
head—wonderfully large brain chambers.
His eyes are extremely intelligent
and expressive. His master
loves him with a great, boisterous
love characteristic of the man—who
will be a great, attractive, lovable
boy when he is eighty. I greet him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>and hope that he may abide in the
flesh till he is one hundred and
eighty. But I took up my pen to
write about the dog—not the master.
The dog and the master are well
mated. Tiger is the dog for the master,
and Mr. Creveling is the master
for the dog. We hardly ever meet
but before we are through shaking
hands Mr. Creveling begins telling
me something about Tiger. This occurred,
as usual, at a hotel where I
was entertaining the clergy a month
or so ago. The story was wonderful,
and is vouched for by reliable witnesses.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tiger occupies the same room with
Mr. and Mrs. Creveling at night. A
sheet is spread for him on the floor
beside the bed. They think as much
of him as they would of a child.
When he is restless during the night,
Mr. Creveling will put his hand out
and pat his head, speaking to him
soothingly. During the day the sheet
on which Tiger sleeps ‘o’ nights’ is
kept under a washstand. This much,
that what follows may be understood.
Now, on a certain Sunday Mr. and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Mrs. Creveling, the young lady, and
all other members of the household
were away—excepting Tiger. He
was left locked in the house. When
they returned, and Mrs. Creveling
went to her room, she found that
Tiger had spent a good portion of
the time of his incarceration in that
room and on the bed. The bed was
in a very tumbled and not very clean
condition—the condition in which the
occupancy of such a dog would naturally
leave it—a condition which any
careful housewife can easily imagine—and
which she can not imagine
without a shudder. Mrs. Creveling
cried out. Mr. Creveling came running.
After him came Tiger. Mr.
Creveling said: ‘Tiger, Tiger, see
what you have done! You have
ruined your missie’s bed. Tiger,
Tiger, I feel like crying!’ Tiger’s
head and tail both dropped. Without
saying another word, Mr. Creveling
went down stairs and into his
study, threw himself on a large sofa,
and covered his face and pretended
to cry. Tiger, who had followed
him, threw himself down on a rug
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>beside the sofa and cried too. Mr.
Creveling had faith in the dog’s intelligence.
He believed that he had
learned a lesson.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Within a few days the family were
all away again. Again Tiger was left
in the house alone. When the family
returned, Mrs. Creveling again went
to her room. Tiger had been there
again in her absence. He had again
been on the bed. But Tiger’s sheet—the
one upon which he slept at night
was there too. And the sheet was
spread out, covering the bed. And
there had been no one to spread out
the sheet for Tiger. He had spread
it out for himself. Is not here a display
of intelligence—of intelligence in
activity in employment—of reason?
What had Tiger done? He had put
his nose under the washstand and
pulled the sheet out. He had put
the sheet on the bed. He had spread
the sheet out over the bed. What had
been Tiger’s train of thought? This,
or something very much like it: ‘I
want to lie on that bed because it reminds
me of my absent master and
mistress. But I don’t dare to do so.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>I will give offence if I do so. I will
be punished. Why am I not wanted
to lie on the bed? Because I soil it.
What shall I do? There is the sheet—my
sheet. They don’t care if I lie
on that. I will spread the sheet over
the bed. What a great head I have!’
The reader understands, of course,
that I am not claiming that Tiger has
sufficient command of the English language
to even subjectively express
himself as I have represented him. I
have only tried to bring as strongly as
possible to the reader’s mind the fact
that a train of thought must have
passed through the dog’s mind. And
a train of thought could not pass
through his mind if he hadn’t a mind.
Having a mind, then what? He thinks.
He reasons. What else? If my mind
is immortal why not Tiger’s? And remember
that I can prove the truth of
every detail of this story by three
witnesses—Mr. Creveling, his wife,
and his wife’s friend. No court
would ask more.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Jules Janin’s dog made him a literary
man. His favourite walk was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>in Luxembourg Garden, where he
was delighted to see his dog gambol.
The dog made another dog’s acquaintance,
and they became so attached
to each other that their masters
were brought together and became
friends. The new friend urged him
to better his fortunes by writing for
the newspapers, and introduced him
to La Lorgnette, from which time he
constantly rose. In 1828 he was appointed
dramatic critic of the Journal
des États, and his popularity there
lasted undiminished for twenty years.</p>

<p class='c004'>London has a home for lost and
starving dogs, for the benefit of which
a concert was recently given. Had
Richard Wagner been alive, he would
have doubtless bought a box for this
occasion. One of the greatest sorrows
of his life was the temporary
loss of his Newfoundland dog in London.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here is a quaint story which shows
the gentle Elia in a most characteristic
way: “Just before the Lambs quitted
the metropolis,” says Pitman, “they
came to spend a day with me at Fulham
and brought with them a companion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>who, dumb animal though he
was, had for some time past been in
the habit of giving play to one of
Charles Lamb’s most amiable characteristics—that
of sacrificing his own
feelings and inclinations to those of
others. This was a large and very
handsome dog, of a rather curious
and sagacious breed, which had belonged
to Thomas Hood, and at the
time I speak of, and to oblige both
dog and master, had been transferred
to the Lambs, who made a great pet
of him, to the entire disturbance and
discomfiture, as it appeared, of all
Lamb’s habits of life, but especially
of that most favourite and salutary of
all—his long and heretofore solitary
suburban walks; for Dash—that was
the dog’s name—would never allow
Lamb to quit the house without him,
and when out, would never go anywhere
but precisely where it pleased
himself. The consequence was, that
Lamb made himself a perfect slave to
this dog, who was always half a mile
off from his companion, either before
or behind, scouring the fields or roads
in all directions, up and down ‘all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>manner of streets,’ and keeping his
attendant in a perfect fever of anxiety
and irritation from his fear of losing
him on the one hand, and his reluctance
to put the needful restraint
upon him on the other. Dash perfectly
well knew his host’s amiable
weakness in this respect, and took a
doglike advantage of it. In the Regent’s
Park, in particular, Dash had
his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quasi</span></i>-master completely at his
mercy, for the moment they got within
the ring he used to squeeze himself
through the railing and disappear
for half an hour together in the then
inclosed and thickly planted greensward,
knowing perfectly well that
Lamb did not dare to move from
the spot where he (Dash) had disappeared,
till he thought proper to show
himself again. And they used to take
this walk oftener than any other, precisely
because Dash liked it, and
Lamb did not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beecher said that “in evolution, the
dog got up before the door was shut.”
If there were not reason, mirthfulness,
love, honour, and fidelity in a dog, he
did not know where to look for them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>And Huxley has devoted much attention
to the study of canine ability. He
once illustrated, by the skeleton of the
animal being raised on hind legs, that
in internal construction the only difference
between man and dog was one
of size and proportion. There was
not a bone in one which did not exist
in the other, not a single constituent
in the one that was not to be found in
the other, and by the same process he
could prove that the dog had a mind.
His own dog was certainly not a mere
piece of animate machinery. He once
possessed a dog which he frequently
left among the thousands frequenting
Regent’s Park to secrete himself behind
a tree. So soon as the animal
found that he had lost his master, he
laid his nose to the ground and soon
tracked him to his hiding place. He
believed there was no fundamental faculty
connected with the reasoning powers
that might not be demonstrated to
exist in dogs. He did not believe that
dogs ever took any pleasure in music;
but this seems not to be always the
case. Adelaide Phillips, the famous
contralto, told me that her splendid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Newfoundland Cæsar was quite a musician.
She gave him singing lessons
regularly. “I see him now,” she said,
“his fore paws resting on my knee.
I would say: ‘Now the lesson begins.
Look at me, sir. Do as I do.’ Then
I would run down the scale in thirds,
and Cæsar, with head thrown back
and swaying from side to side, would
really sing the scale. He would sing
the air of The Brook very correctly.
But it was the best sport to see him
attempt the operatic.” Here her
gestures became showy and impressive,
as if on the stage, and her mimicking
of the dog’s efforts to follow
her were comical in the extreme.
Sometimes (so quickly did he catch
all the tricks of the profession) he
would not sing until urged again and
again. Sometimes he would be “out
of voice,” and make most discordant
sounds. He has an honoured grave
at her country home in Marshfield,
where Webster also put up a
stone in memory of his horse Greatheart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Charlotte Cushman loved animals, especially
dogs and horses; and her blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Skye terrier Bushie, with her human
eyes and uncommon intelligence, has a
permanent place in the memoirs of her
mistress. Miss Cushman would say,
“Play the piano, Bushie,” and Bush
knew perfectly well what was meant,
and would go through the performance,
adding a few recitative barks
with great gravity and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i>. The
phrase “human eyes” recalls what
Blackmore, the novelist—who has a
genuine, loving appreciation of our
dear dumb animals—says of a dog
in Christowell: “No lady in the land
has eyes more lucid, loving, eloquent,
and even if she had, they would be as
nothing without the tan spots over
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Patti has many pets, and always
takes some dog with her on her travels,
causing great commotion at hotels.
She also leaves many behind
her as a necessity. She has an aviary
at her castle in Wales, and owns several
most loquacious parrots.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Mitford’s gushing eulogy upon
one of her numerous dogs is too extravagant
to be quoted at length:
“There never was such a dog. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>temper was, beyond comparison, the
sweetest ever known. Nobody ever
saw him out of humour, and his sagacity
was equal to his temper....
I shall miss him every moment of my
life. We covered his dead body with
flowers; every flower in the garden.
Everybody loved him, dear saint, as
I used to call him, and as I do not
doubt he now is. Heaven bless him,
beloved angel!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Fields writes: “Miss Mitford
used to write me long letters about
Fanchon, a dog whose personal acquaintance
I had made some time
before while on a visit to her cottage.
Every virtue under heaven she attributed
to that canine individual,
and I was obliged to allow in my
return letters that since our planet
began to spin nothing comparable
to Fanchon had ever run on four
legs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Browning was fond of pets,
especially of her dog Flush, presented
by Miss Mitford, which she has immortalized
in a sonnet and a long and
exquisite poem:</p>

      <div class='line'>Till thought on thought drew downward tear on tear;</div>
      <div class='line'>When from the pillow, where wet-cheeked I lay,</div>
      <div class='line'>A head as hairy as Faunus’ thrust its way</div>
      <div class='line'>Right sudden against my face, two golden, clear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Great eyes astonished mine; a drooping ear</div>
      <div class='line'>Did flap me on either cheek to dry the spray.</div>
      <div class='line'>I started first; as some Arcadian</div>
      <div class='line'>Amazed by goatly god in twilight grove;</div>
      <div class='line'>But as the bearded vision closelier ran</div>
      <div class='line'>My tears off, I knew Flush, and rose above</div>

<p class='c004'>Maria Edgeworth wrote to her aunt,
Mrs. Ruxton, in 1819, “I see my little
dog on your lap, and feel your hand
patting his head, and hear your voice
telling him that it is for Maria’s sake
he is there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>What a pathetic friendship existed
between Emily Brontë and the dog
whom she was sure could understand
every word she said to him! “She always
fed the animals herself; the old
cat; Flossy, her favourite spaniel;
Keeper, the fierce bulldog, her own
constant dear companion, whose portrait,
drawn by her own spirited hand,
is still extant. And the creatures on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the moor were all in a sense her pets
and familiar with her. The intense
devotion of this silent woman to all
manner of dumb creatures has something
almost inexplicable. As her old
father and her sisters followed her to
the grave they were joined by another
mourner, Keeper, Emily’s dog. He
walked in front of all, first in the rank
of mourners, and perhaps no other
creature had loved the dead woman
quite so well. When they had laid
her to sleep in the dark, airless vault
under the church, and when they had
crossed the bleak churchyard and had
entered the empty house again, Keeper
went straight to the door of the room
where his mistress used to sleep, and
laid down across the threshold. There
he howled piteously for many days,
knowing not that no lamentations
could wake her any more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Dogs were supposed by the ancient
Gaels to know of the death of a friend,
however far they might be separated.
But this is getting too gloomy. Do
you know how the proverb originated
“as cold as a dog’s nose”? An old
verse tells us:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>There sprang a leak in Noah’s ark,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which made the dog begin to bark;</div>
      <div class='line'>Noah took his nose to stop the hole,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hence his nose is always cold.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>No one has expressed more appreciation
of the noble qualities of dogs than
the abstracted, philosophic Wordsworth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Forster tells us fully of Dickens’s
devotion to his many dogs, quoting
the novelist’s inimitable way of describing
his favourites. In Dr. Marigold
there is an especially good bit
about “me and my dog.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My dog knew as well as I did when
she was on the turn. Before she broke
out he would give a howl and bolt.
How he knew it was a mystery to
me, but the sure and certain knowledge
of it would wake him up out of
his soundest sleep, and would give a
howl and bolt. At such times I wished
I was him.” After the death of child
and wife, he says: “Me and my dog
was all the company left in the cart
now, and the dog learned to give a
short bark when they wouldn’t bid,
and to give another and a nod of his
head when I asked him ‘Who said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>half a crown?’ He attained to an
immense height of popularity, and, I
shall always believe, taught himself
entirely out of his own head to growl
at any person in the crowd that bid
as low as sixpence. But he got to be
well on in years, and one night when
I was convulsing York with the spectacles
he took a convulsion on his own
account, upon the very footboard by
me, and it finished him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Laurence Hutton, in the St.
Nicholas, has lately expressed his sentiments
about dogs, as follows:</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was Dr. John Brown, of Edinburgh,
I think, who spoke in sincere
sympathy of the man who “led a dog-less
life.” It was Mr. “Josh Billings,”
I know, who said that in the whole
history of the world there is but one
thing that money can not buy—to wit,
the wag of a dog’s tail. And it was
Prof. John C. Van Dyke who declared
the other day, in reviewing the artistic
career of Landseer, that he made his
dogs too human. It was the great
Creator himself who made dogs too
human—so human that sometimes
they put humanity to shame.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“I have been the friend and confidant
of three dogs, who helped to humanize
me for the space of a quarter of a
century, and who had souls to be
saved, I am sure, and when I cross
the Stygian River I expect to find on
the other shore a trio of dogs wagging
their tails almost off in their joy
at my coming, and with honest tongues
hanging out to lick my hands and my
feet. And then I am going, with these
faithful, devoted dogs at my heels, to
talk dogs over with Dr. John Brown,
Sir Edward Landseer, and Mr. Josh
Billings.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Do dogs have souls—a spark of
life that after death lives on elsewhere?</p>

<p class='c004'>Many have hoped so, from Wesley
to the little boy who has lost his cherished
comrade.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is certain that dogs show qualities
that in a man would be called reason,
quick apprehension, presence of mind,
courage, self-abnegation, affection unto
death.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the close of this chapter may I
be allowed to tell of two of my special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>friends—one a fox terrier, owned by
Mr. Howard Ticknor, of Boston; the
other my own interesting pet—who
have never failed to learn any trick
suggested to them? Antoninus Pius,
called Tony for short, goes through
more than a score of wonderful accomplishments,
such as playing on
the piano, crossing his paws and looking
extremely artistic, if not inspired,
dancing a skirt dance, spinning on a
flax wheel, performing on a tambourine
swung by a ribbon round his
neck; plays pattycake with his mistress.
And my own intelligent Yorkshire
terrier mounts a chair back and
preaches with animation, eloquence,
and forcible gestures; knocks down
a row of books and then sits on them,
as a book reviewer; stands in a corner
with right paw uplifted, as a tableau
of Liberty enlightening the
World; rings a bell repeatedly and
with increasing energy, to call us to
the table; sings with head and eyes
uplifted, to accompaniment of harmonica—and
each is just beginning
his education.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have read lately an account of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>knowing dog, with a sort of sharp
cockney ability, who used to go daily
with penny in mouth and buy a roll.
Once one right out of the oven was
given to him; he dropped it, seized
his money off the counter, and changed
his baker.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CATS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>God made the cat in order to give to man the
pleasurable sense of having caressed the tiger.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Méry.</span></h3>

<p class='c002'>Public sentiment is not so unanimously
in favour of cats, yet they
have had their warm admirers, while
in Egypt they were adored as divine—worshipped
as an emblem of the
moon. When a cat died, the owners
gave the body a showy funeral, went
into mourning, and shaved off their
eyebrows. Diodorus tells of a Roman
soldier who was condemned to
death for killing a cat. It is said that
Cambyses, King of Persia, when he
went to fight the Egyptians, fastened
before every soldier’s breast a live cat.
Their enemies dared not run the risk
of hurting their sacred pets, and so
were conquered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Artists, monarchs, poets, diplomatists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>religious leaders, authors, have
all condescended to care for cats. A
mere list of their names would make
a big book. For instance, Godefroi
Mind, a German artist, was called the
Raphael of Cats. People would hunt
him up in his attic, and pay large
prices for his pictures. In the long
winter evenings he amused himself
carving tiny cats out of chestnuts,
and could not make them fast enough
for those who wanted to buy. Mohammed
was so fond of his cat Muezza
that once, when she was sleeping
on his sleeve, he cut off the sleeve
rather than disturb her. Andrew Doria,
one of the rulers of Venice, not
only had a portrait painted of his pet
cat, but after her death had her skeleton
preserved as a treasure. Richelieu’s
special favourite was a splendid
Angora, his resting place being the
table covered with state papers. Montaigne
used to rest himself by a frolic
with his cat. Fontenelle liked to
place his “Tom” in an armchair and
deliver an oration before him. The
cat of Cardinal Wolsey sat by his side
when he received princes. Petrarch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>had his pet feline embalmed and
placed in his apartment.</p>

<p class='c004'>You see, the idea of the cat being
the pet of old maids alone is far from
true. Edward Lear, of Nonsense
Verses fame, wrote of himself:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He has many friends, laymen and clerical;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Old Foss is the name of his cat;</div>
      <div class='line'>His body is perfectly spherical;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He weareth a runcible hat.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Wordsworth wrote about a Kitten
and the Falling Leaves. A volume
of two hundred and eighty-five pages
of poems in all languages, consecrated
to the memory of a single cat, was
published at Milan in 1741. Shelley
wrote verses to a cat.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems unjust to assert that the cat
is incapable of personal attachment,
when she has won the affection of so
many of earth’s great ones. The skull
of Morosini’s cat is preserved among
the relics of that Venetian worthy.
Andrea Doria’s cat was painted with
him. Sir Henry Wyat’s gratitude to
the cat who saved him from starvation
in the Tower of London by bringing
him pigeons to eat, caused this remark:
“You shall not find his picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>anywhere but with a cat beside him.”
Cowper often wrote about his cats
and kittens. Horace Walpole wrote to
Gray, mourning the loss of his handsomest
cat, and Gray replied: “I
know Zara and Zerlina, or rather I
knew them both together, for I can
not justly say which was which.
Then, as to your handsomest cat, I
am no less at a loss; as well as knowing
one’s handsomest cat is always the
cat one likes best, or, if one be alive
and the other dead, it is usually the
latter that is handsomest. Besides, if
the point were so clear, I hope you
do not think me so ill bred as to forget
my interest in the survivor—oh,
no! I would rather seem to mistake,
and imagine, to be sure, that it must
be the tabby one.” It was the tabby;
her death being sudden and pitiful,
tumbling from a “lofty vase’s side”
while trying to secure a goldfish for
her dinner. Gray sent Walpole an
ode inspired by the misfortune, in
which he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What woman’s heart can gold despise?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>What cat’s averse to fish?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and thus describes the final scene:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Eight times emerging from the flood,</div>
      <div class='line'>She mewed to every watery god</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Some speedy aid to send.</div>
      <div class='line'>No dolphin came, no Nereid stirred,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor cruel Tom nor Susan heard.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>A favourite has no friend.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Upon Gray’s death, Walpole placed
Zerlina’s vase upon a pedestal marked
with the first stanza.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jeremy Bentham at first christened
his cat Langbourne; afterward, Sir
John Langbourne; and when very
wise and dignified, the Rev. Sir John
Langbourne, D. D. Pius IX allowed
his cat to sit with him at table, waiting
his turn to be fed in a most decorous
manner. Théophile Gautier
tells us how beautifully his cats behaved
at the dinner table. A friend
visiting Bishop Thirlwall in his retirement,
thought he looked weary, and
asked him to take the big easy-chair.
“Don’t you see who is already there?”
said the great churchman, pointing to
a cat asleep on the cushion. “She
must not be disturbed.” Helen Hunt
Jackson devoted a large book to the
praise of cats and kittens. We know
that Isaac Newton was fond of cats,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>for did he not make two holes in his
barn door—a big one for old pussy to
go in and out, and a little one for the
kitty?</p>

<p class='c004'>Among French authors we recall
Rousseau, who has much to say in
favour of felines. Colbert reared half
a dozen cats in his study, and taught
them many interesting tricks. The
cat supplied Perrault with one of the
most attractive subjects of his stories,
and under the magical pen of this admirable
story-teller, Puss in Boots has
become an example of the power of
work, industry, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir-faire</span></i>. Gautier
scoffs at storms raging without,
as long as he has</p>

an intelligent cat a go-between of lovers.
Baudelaire returned from his
wanderings in the East a devotee of
cats, and addressed to them several
fine bits of verse; they are seen in
his poetry, as dogs in the paintings
of Paul Veronese. Here is a sample:</p>

<p class='c004'>Champfleury, another French writer,
has recorded that, visiting Victor Hugo
once, he found, in a room decorated
with tapestries and Gothic furniture, a
cat enthroned on a dais, and apparently
receiving the homage of the company.
Sainte-Beuve’s cat sat on his
desk, and walked freely over his critical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>essays. “I value in the cat,” says
Chateaubriand, “that indifferent and
almost ungrateful temper which prevents
itself from attaching itself to
any one; the indifference with which
it passes from the <em>salon</em> to the housetop.”
Marshal Turenne amused himself
for hours in playing with his kittens.
The great general, Lord Heathfield,
would often appear on the walls
of Gibraltar at the time of the famous
siege, attended by his favourite cats.
Montaigne wrote: “When I play with
my cat, who knows whether I do not
make her more sport than she makes
me? We mutually divert each other
with our play. If I have my hour to
begin or refuse, so has she.” As
George Eliot puts it, “Who can tell
what just criticisms the cat may be
passing on us beings of wider speculation?”
Chateaubriand’s cat Micette
is well known. He used to stroke her
tail, to notify Madame Récamier that
he was tired or bored.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cats and their friendships are not
spoken of in the Bible. But they are
mentioned in Sanskrit writing two
thousand years old, and, as has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>said before, they were household pets
and almost idols with the Egyptians,
who mummied them in company with
kings and princes. They were also
favourites in India and Persia, and
can claim relationship with the royal
felines of the tropics. Simonides, in
his Satire on Women, the earliest extant,
sets it down that froward women
were made from cats, just as most virtuous,
industrious matrons were developed
from beer. In Mills’s History
of the Crusades the cat was an
important personage in religious festivals.
At Aix, in Provence, the finest
he cat was wrapped like a child in
swaddling clothes and exhibited in a
magnificent shrine: every knee bent,
every hand strewed flowers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several cats have been immortalized
by panegyrics and epitaphs from famous

Arnold mourned the great Atossa.
One of Tasso’s best sonnets was addressed
to his favourite cat. Cats
figure in literature from Gammer
Gurton’s Needle to our own day.
Shakespeare mentions the cat forty-four
times—“the harmless, necessary
cat,” etc. Goldsmith wrote:</p>

<p class='c004'>The story of Dick Whittington and
his cat is doubtless true. All the pictorial
and architectural relics of Whittington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>represent him with the cat—a
black and white cat—at his left hand,
or his hand resting on a cat. One of
the figures that adorned the gate at
Newgate represented Liberty with the
figure of a cat lying at her feet. Whittington
was a former founder. In the
cellar of his old house at Gloucester
there was found a stone, probably part
of a chimney, showing in <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">basso-rilievo</span></i>
the figure of a boy carrying in his
arms a cat. Cowper has a poem on A

<p class='c004'>A young girl who was in the house
with Mr. Whittier, and of whom he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>was very fond, went to him one day

said: “My dear little kitty Bathsheba

<p class='c004'>Cats are made very useful. The
English Government keeps cats in
public offices, dockyards, stores, shipping,
and so on. In Vienna, four cats
are employed by town magistrates to
catch mice on the premises of the municipality
with a regular allowance,
voted for their keeping, during active
service, afterward placed on the retired
list with comfortable pension;
much better cared for than college
professors or superannuated ministers
in our country. There are a certain
number of cats in the United States
Post Office to protect mail bags from
rats and mice; also, in the Imperial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Printing Office in France, a feline staff
with a keeper. Cats are given charge
of empty corn sacks, so that they shall
not be nibbled and devoured. Cats

<p class='c004'>Madame Henriette Ronner has given
up half of her long artistic career to the
study of cats, producing a cat world as
impressive as the cattle world of Potter
or the stag and dog world of Landseer.
Harrison Weirs is one of Pussy’s most
devoted adherents. He originated cat
shows at Crystal Palace, London. He
says that dogs, large or small, are generally
useless; while a cat, whether
petted or not, is of service. Without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>her, rats and mice would overrun the
house. If there were not millions of
cats there would be billions of vermin.
He believes that cats are more critical
in noticing than dogs, as he has seen a
cat open latched doors and push back
bolt or bar; they will wait for the
butcher, hoping for bits of meat, looking
for him only on his stated days,
and know the time for the luncheon
bell to ring. Dogs often bite when
angry; cats seldom. They will travel
a long distance to regain home; form
devoted attachments to other animals,
as horses, cocks, collies, cows, hens,
rabbits, squirrels, and even rats, and
can be taught to respect the life of
birds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Exactly opposite opinions are held
by others, equally good and fair judges,
and with these the cat is considered selfish,
spiteful, crafty, treacherous, and,
like a low style of politician, subservient
only to the power that feeds them,
and provides a warm berth to snuggle
down in. And we find many anecdotes,
well authenticated, proving them to
be docile, affectionate, good-tempered,
tractable, and even possessed of something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>very like intellect. In the life of
Sir David Brewster, by his daughter,
we find that a cat in the house entered
his room one day and made friendship
in the most affectionate manner;
“looked straight at him, jumped on
my father’s knee, placed a paw on
each shoulder, and kissed him as distinctly
as a cat could. From that time
the philosopher himself provided her
breakfast every morning from his own
plate, till one day she disappeared, to
the unbounded sorrow of her master.
Nothing was heard of her for nearly
two years, when Pussy walked into
the house, neither thirsty nor footsore,
made her way without hesitation to
the study, jumped on my father’s knee,
placed a paw on each shoulder and
kissed him, exactly as on the first
day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cats can be trained to shake hands,
jump over a stick, sit up on hind legs,
come at a whistle, beg like a dog, but
we seldom take the trouble to find out
how easily they can be taught. Madame
Piozzi (Mrs. Thrale) tells us
of Dr. Johnson’s kindness to his cat,
named Hodge. When the creature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>had grown old and fastidious from illness,
and could eat nothing but oysters,
the gruff old lexicographer always
went out himself to buy Hodge’s dinner.
Boswell adds: “I recollect Hodge
one day scrambling up Dr. Johnson’s
breast apparently with much satisfaction,
while my friend, smiling and half
whistling, rubbed down his back and
pulled him by the tail, and when I observed
he had a fine cat, saying, ‘Why
yes, sir, but I have had cats whom I
liked better than this,’ and then, as if
perceiving Hodge to be out of countenance,
adding, ‘But he is a fine cat,
a very fine cat indeed.’ He once gave
a ludicrous account of the despicable
state of a young gentleman of good
family. ‘Sir, when I heard of him last
he was running about town shooting
cats.’ And then, in a sort of friendly
reverie, he added, ‘But Hodge sha’n’t
be shot; no, Hodge sha’n’t be shot.’”
And this from the gruff, dogmatic thunderer
who snubbed or silenced every
antagonist. Even the selfish, courtly
Lord Chesterfield left a permanent pension
for his cats and their descendants.
Robert Southey has written a Memoir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of the Cats of Greta Hall. He liked
to see his cats look plump and healthy,
and tried to make them comfortable
and happy. When they were ill he
had them carefully nursed by the
“ladies of the kitchen,” and doctored
by the Keswick apothecary. Indeed,
cats and kittens were so petted and
fondled at Greta Hall by old and
young that Southey sometimes called
the place “Cats’ Eden.” In a letter
to one of his cat-loving friends he says
that “a house is never perfectly furnished
for enjoyment unless there is a
child in it rising three years old, and
a kitten rising three weeks.” This
memorial gives such truthful and impartial
biographies of his rat-catching
friends that he deserves to be known
and admired as the Plutarch of Cats.
The history was compiled for his
daughter. He begins in this way:
“Forasmuch, most excellent Edith
May, as you must always feel a natural
and becoming concern in whatever
relates to the house wherein you
were born, and in which the first part
of your life has thus far so happily
been spent, I have for your instruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and delight composed these memoirs,
to the end that the memory of
such worthy animals may not perish,
but be held in deserved honour by my
children and those who shall come
after them.” The sketch is too long
to be given, but it is sparkling with
fun and at times tragic with sad adventures.
Their names were as remarkable
as their characters: Madame
Bianchi; Pulcheria Ovid, so called
because he might be presumed to be
a master in the art of love; Virgil, because
something like Ma-ro might be
detected in his notes of courtship;
Othello, black and jealous; Prester
John, who turned out not to be of
John’s gender, and therefore had the
name altered to Pope Joan; Rumpelstilchen,
a name borrowed from
Grimm’s Tales, and Hurlyburlybuss.
Rumpelstilchen lived nine years. After
describing various cats, their adventures
and misadventures, Madame Bianchi
disappeared, and Pulcheria soon
after died of a disease epidemic at that
time among cats. “For a considerable
time afterward an evil fortune attended
all our attempts at re-establishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>a cattery. Ovid disappeared and
Virgil died of some miserable distemper.
The Pope, I am afraid, came to a
death of which other popes have died.
I suspect that some poison which the
rats had turned out of their holes
proved fatal to their enemy. For
some time I feared we were at the
end of our cat-a-logue, but at last Fortune,
as if to make amends for her late
severity, sent us two at once, the never-to-be-enough-praised
Rumpelstilchen,
and the equally-to-be-admired Hurlyburlybuss.
And ‘first for the first of
these,’ as my huge favourite and almost
namesake Robert South says in
his sermons.” He then explains at
length a German tale in Grimm’s collection
(a most charming tale it is, too),
which gave the former cat his strange
and magi-sonant appellation. “Whence
came Hurlyburlybuss was long a mystery.
He appeared here as Manco
Capac did in Peru and Quetzalcohuatl
among the Aztecs—no one knew
whence. He made himself acquainted
with all the philofelists of the family,
attaching himself more particularly to
Mrs. Lorell; but he never attempted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>to enter the house, frequently disappeared
for days, and once since my
return for so long a time that he was
actually believed to be dead and veritably
lamented as such. The wonder
was, whither did he retire at such
times, and to whom did he belong;
for neither I in my daily walks, nor
the children, nor any of the servants,
ever by chance saw him anywhere except
in our own domain. There was
something so mysterious in this that
in old times it might have excited
strong suspicion, and he would have
been in danger of passing for a witch
in disguise, or a familiar. The mystery,
however, was solved about four
weeks ago, when, as we were returning
home from a walk up the Greta,
Isabel saw him on his transit across
the road and the wall from Shulicson
in a direction toward the hill. But to
this day we are ignorant who has the
honour to be his owner in the eye of
the law, and the owner is equally ignorant
of the high favour in which Hurlyburlybuss
is held, of the heroic name
he has obtained, and that his fame has
extended far and wide; yea, that with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Rumpelstilchen he has been celebrated
in song, and that his glory will go down
to future generations. A strong enmity
existed between these two cats
of remarkable nomenclature, and many
were their altercations. Some weeks
ago Hurlyburlybuss was manifestly
emaciated and enfeebled by ill health,
and Rumpelstilchen with great magnanimity
made overtures of peace.
The whole progress of the treaty was
seen from the parlour window. The
caution with which Rumpel made his
advances, the sullen dignity with which
they were received, their mutual uneasiness
when Rumpel, after a slow and
wary approach seated himself whisker
to whisker with his rival, the mutual
fear which restrained not only teeth
and claws but even all tones of defiance,
the mutual agitation of their
tails, which, though they did not expand
with anger could not be kept
still for suspense, and lastly the manner
in which Hurly retreated, like
Ajax, still keeping his face toward his
old antagonist, were worthy to have
been represented by that painter who
was called the Raphael of Cats. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>overture, I fear, was not accepted as
generously as it was made, for no
sooner had Hurlyburlybuss recovered
strength than hostilities were recommenced
with greater violence than
before. Dreadful were the combats
which ensued.... All means of reconciling
them and making them understand
how goodly a thing it is for cats
to dwell together in peace, and what
fools they are to quarrel and tear each
other, are vain. The proceedings of
the Society for the Abolition of War
are not more utterly ineffectual and
hopeless. All we can do is to act
more impartially than the gods did
between Achilles and Hector, and
continue to treat both with equal regard.”
I will only add the closing
words: “And thus having brought
down these Memoirs of the Cats of
Greta Hall to the present day, I commit
the precious memorial to your
keeping. Most dissipated and light-heeled
daughter, your most diligent
and light-hearted father, Keswick, 18
June, 1824.” Rumpel lived nine years,
surrounded by loving attentions, and
when he died, May 18, 1833, Southey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>wrote to an old friend, Grosvenor
Bedford: “Alas! Grosvenor, this day
poor old Rumpel was found dead, after
as long and happy a life as cat could
wish for, if cats form wishes on that subject.
There should be a court mourning
in cat land, and if the Dragon (a
cat of Mr. Bedford’s) wear a black ribbon
around his neck, or a band of crepe,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la militaire</span></i>, round one of the forepaws,
it will be but a becoming mark
of respect. As we have no catacombs
here, he is to be decently interred in
the orchard, and catnip planted on his
grave.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Among modern celebrities who are
fond of cats are the actress, Ellen
Terry, who loves to play with kittens
on the floor; Mr. Edmund Yates, the
late novelist and journalist, whose cat
used to sit down to dinner beside her
master; and Julian Hawthorne, who
has a faithful friend in his noble Tom,
who invariably sits on his shoulder
while he is writing. And when Tom
thinks enough work has been done for
one sitting, he gets down to the table
and pulls away the manuscript. A cat
denoted liberty, and was carved at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>feet of the Roman Goddess of Liberty.
Cats are seldom given credit for either
intelligence or affection, but many
trustworthy anecdotes prove that they
possess both, and also that they seem
to understand what is said, not only
to them but about them. They are
more unsophisticated than the dog;
civilization to them has not yet become
second nature.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>A Cat Story.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>You may be interested in hearing of
the crafty trick of a black Persian.
Prin is a magnificent animal, but
withal a most dainty one, showing
distinct disapproval of any meat not
cooked in the especial way he likes,
viz., roast. The cook, of whom he is
very fond, determined to break this
bad habit. Stewed or boiled meat was
accordingly put ready for him, but, as
he had often done before, he turned
from it in disgust. However, this time
no fish or roast was substituted. For
three days the saucer of meat was untouched,
and no other food given. But
on the fourth morning the cook was
much rejoiced at finding the saucer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>empty. Prin ran to meet her, and the
good woman told her mistress how extra
affectionate that repentant cat was
that morning. He did enjoy his dinner
of roast that day (no doubt served with
a double amount of gravy). It was not
till the pot-board under the dresser was
cleaned on Saturday that his artfulness
was brought to light. There, in one
of the stewpans back of the others, was
the contents of the saucer of stewed
meat. There was no other animal
about the place, and the other two
servants were as much astonished as
the cook at the clever trick played on
them by this terribly spoiled pet of
the house. But the cook was mortified
at the thought of that saucer of roast
beef. I know this story to be true, and
I have known the cat for the last nine
or ten years. It lives at Clapham.</p>

<p class='c002'>I will close this catalogue of feline
attractions with two conundrums:
Why does a cat cross the road? Because
it wants to get to the other
side. What is that which never was
and never will be? A mouse’s nest in
a cat’s ear.</p>

<p class='c004'>James I, of England, whom Dickens
designates as “His Sowship,” to
express his detestation of his character,
had a variety of dumb favourites.
Although a remorseless destroyer
of animals in the chase, he had an intense
pleasure in seeing them around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>him happy and well cared for in a state
of domesticity. In 1623 John Bannat
obtained a grant of the king’s interest
in the leases of two gardens and a
tenement in the Nuriones, on the condition
of building and maintaining a
house wherein to keep and rear his
Majesty’s newly imported silkworms.
Sir Thomas Dale, one of the settlers of
the then newly formed colony of Virginia,
returning to Europe on leave,
brought with him many living specimens
of American zoölogy, among
them some flying squirrels. This
coming to his Majesty’s ears, he was
seized with a boyish impatience to
add them to the private menageries
in St. James’s Park. At the council
table and in the circle of his courtiers
he recurs again and again to the subject,
wondering why Sir Thomas had
not given him “the first pick” of his
cargo of curiosities. He reminded
them how the recently arrived Muscovite
ambassador had brought him
live sables, and, what he loved even
better, splendid white gyrfalcons of
Iceland; and when Buckingham suggested
that in the whole of her reign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Queen Elizabeth had never received
live sables from the Czar, James made
special inquiries if such were really
the case. Some one of his loving subjects,
desirous of ministering to his
favourite hobby, had presented him
with a cream-coloured fawn. A nurse
was immediately hired for it, and the
Earl of Shrewsbury commissioned to
write as follows to Miles Whytakers,
signifying the royal pleasure as to future
procedure: “The king’s Majesty
hath commissioned me to send this
rare beast, a white hind calf, unto
you, together with a woman, his nurse,
that hath kept it and bred it up. His
Majesty would have you see it be
kept in every respect as this good
woman doth desire, and that the
woman be lodged and boarded by
you until his Majesty come to Theobald’s
on Monday next, and then
you shall know further of his pleasure.
What account his Majesty maketh of
this fine beast you may guess, and
no man can suppose it to be more
rare than it is; therefore I know that
your care of it will be accordingly.
So in haste I bid you my hearty farewell.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>At Whitehall, this 6th of November,
1611.”</p>

<p class='c004'>About 1629 the King of Spain effected
an important diversion in his own
favour by sending the king—priceless
gift—an elephant and five camels. Going
through London after midnight,
says a state paper, they could not pass
unseen, and the clamour and outcry
raised by some street loiterers at sight
of their ponderous bulk and ungainly
step, roused the sleepers from their
beds in every street through which
they passed. News of this unlooked-for
addition to the Zoölogical Garden
is conveyed to Theobald’s as speedily
as horseflesh, whip and spur, could
do their work. Then arose an interchange
of missives to and fro betwixt
the king, my lord treasurer, and Mr.
Secretary Connay, grave, earnest, deliberate,
as though involving the settlement
or refusal of some treaty of
peace. In muttered sentences, not
loud but deep, the thrifty lord treasurer
shows “how little he is in love
with royal presents, which cost his
master as much to maintain as could
a garrison.” No matter. Warrants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>are issued to the officers of the Mews
and to Buckingham, master of the
horse, that the elephant is to be daily
well dressed and fed, but that he
should not be led forth to water, nor
any admitted to see him without directions
from his keeper. The camels
are to be daily grazed in the park, but
brought back at night with all possible
precautions to secure them from
the vulgar gaze. The elephant had
two Spaniards and two Englishmen to
take care of him, and the royal quadruped
had royal fare. His keepers
affirm that from the month of September
till April he must drink not
water but wyne; and from April to
September “he must have a gallon of
wyne the day.” His winter allowance
was six bottles per diem, but perhaps
his keepers relieved him occasionally
of a portion of the tempting beverage
which they probably thought too good
to waste on an animal even if it be a
royal elephant.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Voltaire was living near Geneva
he owned a large monkey which
used to attack and even bite both
friends and enemies. This repulsive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>pet one day gave his master three
wounds in the leg, obliging him for
some time to hobble on crutches. He
had named the creature Luc, and in
conversation with intimate friends he
also gave the King of Prussia the same
name, because, said he, “Frederick is
like my monkey, who bites those who
caress him.” As a contrast, remember
how the hermit, Thoreau, used to cultivate
the acquaintance of a little mouse
until it became really tame and would
play a game of bopeep with his eccentric
friend.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing seems too odd or disagreeable
to be regarded with affection.
Lord Erskine, who always expressed
a great interest in animals, had at
one time two leeches for favourites.
Taken dangerously ill at Portsmouth,
he fancied that they had saved his life.
Every day he gave them fresh water
and formed a friendship with them.
He said he was sure that both knew
him, and were grateful for his attentions.
He named them Home and
Cline, for two celebrated surgeons,
and he affirmed that their dispositions
were quite different; in fact, he thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>he distinguished individuality in these
black squirmers from the mire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even pigs have had the good fortune
to interest persons of genius.
Robert Herrick had a pet pig which
he fed daily with milk from a silver
tankard, and Miss Martineau had the
same odd fancy. She, too, had a pet
pig which she had washed and scrubbed
daily. When too ill to superintend the
operation she would listen at her window
for piggie’s squeal, advertising
that the operation had commenced.</p>

<p class='c004'>John Wilson, better known as Christopher
North, loved many pets, and
was as unique in his methods with
them as in all other things. His intense
fondness for animals and birds
was often a trial to the rest of the
family, as when his daughter found
he had made a nest for some young
gamecocks in her trunk of party
dresses which was stored in the attic.
On his library table, where “fishing
rods found company with Ben Jonson
and Jeremy Taylor reposed near a
box of barley-sugar,” a tame sparrow
he had befriended hopped blithely
about, master of the situation. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>tiny pet imagined itself the most important
occupant of the room. It
would nestle in his waistcoat, hop
upon his shoulder, and seemed influenced
by constant association with a
giant, for it grew in stature until it
was alleged that the sparrow was
gradually becoming an eagle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Rev. Gilbert White, who wrote
the Natural History of Selborne, speaks
of a tortoise which he petted, saying,
“I was much taken with its sagacity
in discerning those that show it kind
offices, for as soon as the good old
lady comes in sight who has waited
on it for more than thirty years, it
hobbles toward its benefactress with
awkward alacrity, but remains inattentive
to strangers.” Thus not only
“the ox knoweth his owner and the
ass his master’s crib,” but the most abject
reptile and torpid of beings distinguishes
the hand that feeds it, and is
touched with the feelings of gratitude.
Think of Jeremy Bentham growing a
sort of vetch in his garden to cram his
pockets with to feed the deer in Kensington
Gardens! “I remember,” says
his friend who tells the story, “his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>pointing it out to me and telling me
the virtuous deer were fond of it, and
ate it out of his hand.” Like Byron,
he once kept a pet bear, but he was in
Russia at the time, and the wolves got
into the poor creature’s box on a terrible
night and carried off a part of
his face, a depredation which the philosopher
never forgot nor forgave to
his dying day. He always kept a supply
of stale bread in a drawer of his
dining table for the “mousies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Brownings had many pets,
among them an owl, which after
death was stuffed and given an honoured
position in the poet’s library.
Sydney Smith professed not to care
for pets, especially disliking dogs; but
he named his four oxen Tug and Lug,
Haul and Crawl, and dosed them when
he fancied they needed medicine. Miss
Martineau relates that a phrenologist
examining Sydney’s head announced,
“This gentleman is a naturalist, always
happy among his collections of birds
and fishes.” “Sir,” said Sydney, turning
upon him solemnly with wide-open
eyes—“sir, I don’t know a fish from
a bird.” But this ignorance and indifference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>were all assumed. His daughter,
writing of his daily home life, says:
“Dinner was scarcely over ere he called
for his hat and stick and sallied forth
for his evening stroll. Each cow and
calf and horse and pig were in turn
visited and fed and patted, and all
seemed to welcome him; he cared
for their comforts as he cared for the
comforts of every living being around
him.” He used to say: “I am for all
cheap luxuries, even for animals; now,
all animals have a passion for scratching
their back bones; they break down
your gates and palings to effect this.
Look, this is my Universal Scratcher,
a sharp-edged pole resting on a high
and low post, adapted to every height,
from a horse to a lamb. Even the
Edinburgh Reviewer can take his turn;
you have no idea how popular it is.”
Who could resist repeating just here
the wit’s impromptu epigram upon the
sarcastic, diminutive Jeffrey when the
caustic critic was surprised riding on
the children’s pet donkey? “I still
remember the joy-inspiring laughter
that burst from my father at this unexpected
sight, as, advancing toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>his old friend, with a face beaming
with delight, he exclaimed:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Witty as Horatius Flaccus,</div>
      <div class='line'>As great a Jacobin as Gracchus,</div>
      <div class='line'>Short, though not as fat as Bacchus,</div>
      <div class='line'>Riding on a little jackass.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Before saying good-bye to the donkey
I must give the appeal of Mr.
Evarts’s little daughter at their summer
home in Windsor, Vermont, to
her learned and judicial father; so
naïve and irresistible:</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Papa</span>: Do come home soon.
The donkey is so lonesome without
you!”</p>

<p class='c002'>I once heard Mr. Evarts lamenting
to Chief-Justice Chase that he had been
badly beaten at a game of High Low
Jack by Ben, the learned pig. “I
know now,” said he, “why two pipes
are called a hog’s head. It is on account
of their great capacity!”</p>

<p class='c004'>One would fancy that a busy lawyer
would have no time to give to pets, but
this is far from true. Burnet, in his life
of Sir Matthew Hale, the most eminent
lawyer in the time of Charles I and
Cromwell, says of him, that “his mercifulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>extended even to his beasts, for
when the horses that he had kept long
grew old, he would not suffer them
to be sold or much wrought, but ordered
his man to turn them loose on
his grounds and put them only to easy
work, such as going to market and the
like. He used old dogs also with the
same care; his shepherd having one
that was blind with age, he intended
to have killed or lost him, but the judge
coming to hear of it made one of his
servants bring him home and feed him
till he died. And he was scarce ever
seen more angry than with one of his
servants for neglecting a bird that he
kept so that it died for want of food.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Daniel Webster’s fondness for animals
is well known. When his friends
visited him at Marshfield the first excursion
they must take would be to his
barns and pastures, where he would
point out the beauties of an Alderney,
and mention the number of quarts she
gave daily, with all a farmer’s pride,
adding, “I know, for I measured it
myself.” Choate used to tell a story
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</span></i> of this. Once, when spending
the Sabbath at Marshfield, he went to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>his room after breakfast to read. Soon
there came an authoritative knock at
the door, and Mr. Webster shouted,
“What are you doing, Choate?” He
replied, “I’m reading.” “Oh,” said
Webster, “come down and see the
pigs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He would often rout up his son
Fletcher at a provokingly early hour
to go out and hold a lantern while he
fed the oxen with nubs of corn; and,
noticing a decided lack of enthusiasm
in Fletcher, would say: “You do not
enjoy this society, my son; it’s better
than I find in the Senate.” It was a
touching scene when on the last day,
when he sat in his loved library, he
longed to look once more into the
kindly faces of his honest oxen, and
had them driven up to the window to
say good-bye. Speaking of Choate
recalls a comical story about his finding
in his path, during a summer
morning’s walk, a dozen or more dorbeetles
sprawling on their backs in the
highway enjoying the warm sunshine.
With great care he tipped them all
over into a normal position, when a
friend coming along asked curiously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“What are you doing, Mr. Choate?”
“Why, these poor creatures got overturned,
and I am helping them to take
a fresh start.” “But,” said the other,
“they do that on purpose; they are
sunning themselves, and will go right
back as they were.” This was a new
idea to the puzzled pleader, but with
one of those rare smiles which lit up
his sad, dark face so wonderfully, he
said: “Never mind, I’ve put them
right; if they go back, it is at their
own risk.” And an interesting anecdote
is told in his biography of his
touch of human sympathy for inanimate
objects: “When as a boy he
drove his father’s cows, he says, more
than once when he had thrown away
his switch, he has returned to find it,
and has carried it back and thrown it
under the tree from which he took it,
for he thought, ‘Perhaps there is, after
all, some yearning of Nature between
them still.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>There are enough anecdotes about
birds as pets to fill another big book.
One of Dickens’s most delightful characters
was ponderous, impetuous Lawrence
Boythorn, with his pet bird lovingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>circling about him. In Washington,
in Salmon P. Chase’s home,
when he was Secretary of the Treasury,
lived a pet canary, one of the
tamest, which had a special liking for
the grave, reserved statesman. It was
allowed to fly about the room freely,
and had an invariable habit of calmly
waiting beside the secretary at dinner
until he had used his finger-bowl; then
Master Canary would take possession
of it for a bath. In Jean Paul Richter’s
study stood a table with a cage of canaries.
Between this and his writing
table ran a little ladder, on which the
birds could hop their way to the
poet’s shoulder, where they frequently
perched.</p>

<p class='c004'>Celia Thaxter loved birds. She
writes: “I can not express to you my
distress at the destruction of the birds.
You know how I love them; every
other poem I have written has some
bird for its subject, and I look at the
ghastly horror of women’s headgear
with absolute suffering. I remonstrate
with every wearer of birds.
No woman worthy of the name would
wish to be instrumental in destroying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the dear, beautiful creatures, and for
such idle folly—to deck their heads
like squaws—who are supposed to
know no better—when a ribbon or a
flower would serve their purpose just
as well, and not involve this fearful
sacrifice.” In a letter she describes a
night visit from birds.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two or three of the earlier were
down in the big bay window, and between
two and three o’clock in the
morning it began softly to rain, and
all at once the room filled with birds:
song sparrows, flycatchers, wrens, nuthatches,
yellow birds, thrushes, all
kinds of lovely feathered creatures
fluttered in and sat on picture frames
and gas fixtures, or whirled, agitated,
in mid air, while troops of others beat
their heads against the glass outside,
vainly striving to get in. The light
seemed to attract them as it does the
moths. We had no peace, there was
such a crowd, such cries and chirps
and flutterings. I never heard of such
a thing; did you?</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, the birds! I do believe few
people enjoy them as you and I do.
The song sparrows and white-throats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>follow after me like chickens when
they see me planting. The martins
almost light on my head; the humming
birds <em>do</em>, and tangle their little
claws in my hair; so do the sparrows.
I wish somebody were here to tell me
the different birds, and recognise these
different voices. There are more birds
than usual this year, I am happy to say.
The women have not assassinated them
all for the funeral pyres they carry on
their heads.... What between the
shrikes and owls and cats and weasels
and women—worst of all—I wonder
there’s a bird left on this planet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the yard of the house at Newton,
where we used to live, I was in
the habit of fastening bones (from
cooked meat) to a cherry tree which
grew close to my sitting-room window;
and when the snow lay thick upon the
ground that tree would be alive with
blue jays and chickadees, and woodpeckers,
red-headed and others, and
sparrows (not English), and various
other delightful creatures. I was
never tired watching them and listening
to them. The sweet housekeeping
of the martins in the little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>boxes on my piazza roof is more enchanting
to me than the most fascinating
opera, and I worship music.
I think I must have begun a conscious
existence as some kind of a
bird in æons past. I love them so!
I am always up at four, and I hear
everything every bird has to say on
any subject whatever. Tell me, have
you ever tied mutton and beef bones
to the trees immediately around the
house where you live for the birds?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Maclise was one of the intimate associates,
if we may use the expression,
of Dickens’s celebrated Raven. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>letter in which the bereaved owners
announced to Maclise the death of
this interesting bird has been published,
but the reply of the artist is
now printed for the first time:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>March 13, 1841.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Dickens</span>: I received the
mournful intelligence of our friend’s
decease last night at eleven, and the
shock was great indeed. I have just
dispatched the announcement to poor
Forster, who will, I am sure, sympathize
deeply with our bereavement.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know not what to think is the
probable cause of his death—I reject
the idea of the Butcher Boy, for the
orders he must have in his (the Raven’s)
lifetime received on acct. of the Raven
himself must have been considerable—I
rather cling to the notion of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de
se</span></i>, but this will no doubt come out
upon the post mortem. How blest
we are to have such an intelligent
coroner in Mr. Wakely! I think he
was just of those grave, melancholic
habits which are the noticeable signs
of your intended suicide—his solitary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>life—those gloomy tones, when he did
speak—which was always to the purpose,
witness his last dying speech—‘Hallo,
old girl!’ which breathes of
cheerfulness and triumphant resignation—his
solemn suit of raven black
which never grew rusty—altogether
his character was the very prototype
of a Byron Hero and even of a Scott—a
master of Ravenswood——We
ought to be glad he had his family,
I suppose; he seems to have intended
it, however, for his solicitude to deposit
in those Banks in the Garden
his savings, were always very touching—I
suppose his obsequies will take
place immediately—It is beautiful—the
idea of his return soon after death
to the scene of his early youth and
all his joyful associations, to lie with
kindred dusts amid his own ancestral
groves, after having come out
and made such a noise in the world,
having clearly booked his place in
that immortality coach driven by
Dickens.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, he committed suicide, he felt
he had done it and done with life—the
hundreds of years!! What were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>they to him? There was nothing near
to live for—and he committed the
rash act.</p>

<p class='c002'>The pet dove of Thurlow Weed
seemed inconsolable after his death.
When any gentleman called at the
house the bird would alight on his
shoulder, coo, and peer into his face.
Then finding it was not his dear
friend, he would sadly seek some
other perch. Miss Weed writes:
“Since the day that father’s remains
were carried away, the affectionate
creature has been seeking for his master.
He flies through every room in
the house, and fairly haunts the library.
Many times every day the mourning
bird comes and takes a survey of the
room. He will tread over every inch
of space on the lounge, and then go
to the rug, over which he will walk
repeatedly, as if in expectation of his
dead master’s coming. Does not this
seem akin to human grief?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Whittier wrote a good deal about
his pet parrot. Read his poem called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“The Bird’s Question.” After his
tragic end, the Quaker bard wrote of
him: “I have met with a real loss.
Poor Charlie is dead. He has gone
where the good parrots go. He has
been ailing and silent for some time,
and he finally died. Do not laugh at
me, but I am sorry enough to cry if
it would do any good. He was an old
friend. Lizzie liked him. And he
was the heartiest, jolliest, pleasantest
old fellow I ever saw.” He used to
perch upon the back of his master’s
chair at meal time; at times disgracefully
profane, especially when in moments
of extreme excitement he would
climb to the steeple by way of the
lightning rod, and there he would
dance and sing and swear on a Sunday
morning, amusing the passer-by
and shocking his owner. At last he
fell down the chimney, and was not
discovered for two days. He was rescued
in the middle of the night, and, although
he partially recovered, he soon
died. Whittier said: “We buried poor
Charlie decently. If there is a parrot’s
paradise he ought to go there.”
He also had a pet Bantam rooster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>which would perch on his shoulder,
and liked to be buttoned up in his
coat. Grace Greenwood in Heads
or Tails speaks of a diplomatic parrot
belonging to Seward, at Washington,
taking part in political discussion, trying
to scream Sumner down, and so
sympathetic that when his master had
a cough he had symptoms of bronchitis.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a trustworthy collection of epitaphs
may be found this quaint tribute
with old-fashioned formality to a pet
bird:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here lieth, aged three months, the
body of Richard Acanthus, a young
person of unblemished character. He
was taken in his callow infancy from
the wing of a tender parent by the
rough and pitiless hand of a two-legged
animal without feathers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Though born with the most aspiring
disposition and unbending love of
freedom he was closely confined in a
grated prison, and scarcely permitted
to view those fields of which he had
an undoubted charter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Deeply sensible of this infringement
of his natural rights, he was often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>heard to petition for redress in the most
plaintive notes of harmonious sorrow.
At length his imprisoned soul burst
the prison which his body could not,
and left a lifeless heap of beauteous
feathers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If suffering innocence can hope for
retribution, deny not to the gentle
shade of this unfortunate captive the
humble though uncertain hope of animating
some happier form; or trying
his new-fledged pinions in some happy
Elysium, beyond the reach of <span class='sc'>Man</span>,
the tyrant of this lower world.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Few women are so fond of pets as
Sarah Bernhardt. She carries five or
six with her in all her travels. When
in New York the French actress has
apartments at the Hoffman House.
When the writer last visited her there
he was received, upon entering the
sitting room, by half a dozen dogs,
ranging in size and species from the
massive St. Bernard to the tiny, shivering
black and tan.</p>

<p class='c004'>The actress rose from a low divan
and extended one hand to her guest
while she pressed two very small
snakes to her bosom with the other.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>After she had resumed her seat upon
the divan, and while conversing, she
fondled the snakes or allowed them to
squirm at will over her person.</p>

<p class='c004'>In reply to questions, Madame Bernhardt
said that the snakes were used
in the famous scene where Cleopatra
presses the asp to her bosom and dies.
The actress explained that the snakes
with which she was playing were presented
to her by a gentleman in Philadelphia.
She spoke regretfully of the
death of the snakes which she had
brought with her from France, and
which had succumbed to the hardships
of the ocean voyage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Emily Crawford tells some good
stories about “The Elder Dumas,”
the most dashingly picturesque character,
surely, in the whole range of
literature. We quote a paragraph
showing Dumas’s fondness for animals:</p>

<p class='c004'>“At his architectural folly of Monte
Cristo, near Saint-Germain-en-Laye,
which he built at a cost of upward of
seven hundred thousand francs, and
sold for thirty-six thousand francs in
1848, Dumas had uninclosed grounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>and gardens, which, with the house,
afforded lodgings and entertainment
not only to a host of Bohemian
‘sponges,’ but to all the dogs, cats,
and donkeys that chose to quarter
themselves in the place. It was called
by the neighbours ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Maison de Bon
Dieu</span></i>.’ There was a menagerie in the
park, peopled by three apes; Jugurtha,
the vulture, whose transport
from Africa, whence Dumas fetched
him, cost forty thousand francs (it
would be too long to tell why); a big
parrot called Duval; a macaw named
Papa, and another christened Everard;
Lucullus, the golden pheasant; Cæsar,
the game-cock; a pea-fowl and a guinea-fowl;
Myeouf II, the Angora cat, and
the Scotch pointer, Pritchard. This
dog was a character. He was fond of
canine society, and used to sit in the
road looking out for other dogs to
invite them to keep him company at
Monte Cristo. He was taken by his
master to Ham to visit Louis Napoleon
when a prisoner there. The
latter wished to keep Pritchard, but
counted without the intelligence of
the animal in asking Dumas before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>his face to leave him behind. The
pointer set up a howl so piteous that
the governor of the prison withdrew
the authorization he had given his
captive to retain him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It is difficult to think of any created
thing that has not been found sufficiently
interesting to be petted by
some one!</p>

<p class='c004'>Pliny tells us of a cow that followed
a Pythagorean philosopher on all his
travels. Proud Wolsey was on familiar
terms with a venerable carp. St.
Anthony had a fondness for pigs.
Frank Buckland took to rats. Buffon’s
toad has become historical. Clive
owned a pet tortoise. Gautier wrote
of his lizards, magpie, and chameleon.
Butterflies and crickets have been
domesticated and found responsive.
Rosa Bonheur used to be always escorted
by two great dogs, one on
either side, while in her home a favourite
monkey played upon her staircase,
and amused visitors with its gambols
and pranks. Cowper doffed his
melancholy to play with hares, and
immortalized his rather ungrateful
pensioners in verse:</p>

      <div class='line'>Innocent partner of my peaceful home,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom ten long years’ experience of my care</div>
      <div class='line'>Has made at last familiar; she has lost</div>

      <div class='line'>Not needful here, beneath a roof like mine.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes—thou mayst eat thy bread, and lick the hand</div>
      <div class='line'>That feeds thee; thou mayst frolic on the floor</div>
      <div class='line'>At ev’ning, and at night retire secure</div>
      <div class='line'>To thy straw couch, and slumber unalarmed;</div>
      <div class='line'>For I have gained thy confidence, have pledged</div>
      <div class='line'>All that is human in me, to protect</div>
      <div class='line'>Thine unsuspecting gratitude and love.</div>

      <div class='line'>And, when I place thee in it, sighing say,</div>
      <div class='line'>I knew at least one hare that had a friend.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>James M. Hoppin, in his Old England,
tells of his visit to Olney, where
Cowper lived. He went to the rooms
where he kept his hares, Puss, Bess,
and Tiny; of the veteran survivor of
this famous trio he says Cowper wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Though duly from my hand he took</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His pittance every night,</div>
      <div class='line'>He did it with a jealous look,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And when he could, would bite.</div>

<p class='c004'>Dr. John Hall was seen trudging
through Central Park last winter, followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>by a troop of frisky little gay
squirrels. He had been feeding nuts
to them, and they scattered the snow
in clouds as they scampered along
hoping to get more.</p>

<p class='c004'>It would be interesting to quote
from very many distinguished persons
who believe in the immortality
of the lower animals.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Shaftesbury says: “I have ever
believed in a happy future for animals.
I can not say or conjecture how or
where, but sure I am that the love so
manifested, by dogs especially, is an
emanation from the Divine essence,
and as such it can, or rather it will,
never be extinguished.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frances Power Cobbe wrote: “I
entirely believe in a higher existence
hereafter, both for myself and for those
whose less happy lives on earth entitle
them far more to expect it, from eternal
love and justice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Somerville said: “The dear animals
I believe we shall meet. They suffer
so often here they must live again!
Pain seems a poor proof of immortality,
but it is used by theologians,
and we find many great souls who believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and hope that animals may also
have another life. Agassiz believed
in this firmly. Bishop Butler saw no
reason why the latent powers and capacities
of the lower animals should
not be developed in the future, and
in his Analogy of Religion he endeavoured
to carry out this train of thought,
and to show that the lower animals do
possess those mental and moral characteristics
which we admit in ourselves
to belong to the immortal spirit and not
to the perishable body.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Rev. J. G. Wood has written
a most interesting book on Man and
Beast: Here and Hereafter, with the
especial aim of proving the immortality
of the brute creation, showing
that they share with man the attributes
of reason, language, memory, a
sense of moral responsibility, unselfishness,
and love, all of which belong
to the spirit and not to the body.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bayard Taylor says, “If one should
surmise a lower form of spiritual being
yet equally indestructible, who
need take alarm?” “Yea, they have
all one breath, so that a man hath no
pre-eminence above a beast, for all is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>vanity,” said the Preacher, more than
two thousand years ago. In Taylor’s
poem to an old horse, Ben Equus,
which died on the farm when he was
a young man, he uses the same idea:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For I may dream fidelity like thine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>May save some essence in thee from decay,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, not neglected by the Soul Divine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thy being rises on some unknown way.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Some intermediate heaven, where fields are fresh,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And golden stables littered deep with fern;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where fade the wrongs that horses knew in flesh,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And all the joys that horses felt return.</div>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Mary Somerville wrote these
words at the age of eighty-nine: “If
animals have no future, the existence
of many is most wretched. Multitudes
are starved, cruelly beaten, and
loaded during life; many die under a
barbarous vivisection. I can not believe
that any creature was created
for uncompensated misery; it would
be contrary to the attributes of God’s
mercy and justice. I am sincerely
happy to find that I am not the only
believer in the immortality of the
lower animals.” Lamartine has the
same thought in an address to his
dog, and many other wise men have
hoped that such a future was a reality.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Rev. Henry Storrs says it is
wisest to treat animals kindly, because,
if we are ever to meet them again, it
will be pleasanter to have them on our
side.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henry Ward Beecher many times
owned his love for horses, as in his
one novel, Norwood:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“I tell you,” said Hiram, turning
slightly toward the doctor, “these
horses are jest as near human as is
good for ’em. A good horse has
sense jest as much as a man has; and
he’s proud, too, and he loves to be
praised, and he knows when you treat
him with respect. A good horse has
the best p’ints of a man without his
failin’s.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you think becomes of
horses, Hiram, when they die?” said
Rose.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wal, Miss Rose, it’s my opinion
that there’s use for horses hereafter,
and that you’ll find there’s a horse-heaven.
There’s Scripture for that,
too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah!” said Rose, a little surprised
at these confident assertions. “What
Scripture do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, in the Book of Revelation!
Don’t it give an account of a white
horse, and a red horse, and black
horses, and gray horses? I’ve allers
s’posed that when it said Death rode
on a pale horse, it must have been
gray, ’cause it had mentioned white
once already. In the ninth chapter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>too, it says there was an army of two
hundred thousand horsemen. Now, I
should like to know where they got
so many horses in heaven, if none of
’em that die off here go there? It’s
my opinion that a good horse’s a
darned sight likelier to go to heaven
than a bad man!”</p>

<p class='c004'>When we see the superiority of a
noble horse to his brutal or drunken
driver, it seems at least possible, and
most of us have lost some pet that we
would rather meet again than the majority
of our acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c004'>Helen Barron Bostwick, after “burying
her pretty brown mare under the

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

<p class='c013'>and closes her poem as follows:</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Edwin Arnold has translated
much that is touching about those
who are devoted to animals. A sinful
woman led out to die by stoning
was pardoned by the king, because of
her pity, even at that terrible crisis,
for a dying dog:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Glaring upon the water out of reach,</div>
      <div class='line'>And praying succor in a silent speech,</div>
      <div class='line'>So piteous were its eyes which, when she saw,</div>
      <div class='line'>This woman from her foot her shoe did draw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Albeit death-sorrowful, and looping up</div>
      <div class='line'>The long silk of her girdle, made a cup</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the heel’s hollow, and thus let it sink</div>
      <div class='line'>Until it touched the cool, black water’s brink,</div>
      <div class='line'>So filled the embroidered shoe and gave a draught</div>
      <div class='line'>To the spent beast.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>This brute beast</div>
      <div class='line'>Testifies for thee, sister! whose weak breast</div>
      <div class='line'>Death could not make ungentle. I hold rule</div>
      <div class='line'>In Allah’s stead, who is the merciful,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hope for mercy; therefore go thou free—</div>

<p class='c004'>We send missionaries to the East to
teach those who in some respects are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>well fitted by their pure lives, exalted

the story of the man who would
not enter heaven and leave his dog behind!</p>

      <div class='line'>But the king answered: “O thou Wisest One,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who knowest what was, and is, and is to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still one more grace: this hound hath ate with me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Followed me, loved me: must I leave him now?”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Monarch,” spake Indra, “thou art now as we—</div>

      <div class='line'>And all the joys of heaven are thine for aye.</div>
      <div class='line'>What hath a beast with these? Leave here thy hound.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet Yudhishthira answered: “O Most High,</div>
      <div class='line'>O thousand-eyed and wisest; can it be</div>
      <div class='line'>That one exalted should seem pitiless?</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, let me lose such glory: for its sake</div>
      <div class='line'>I would not leave one living thing I loved.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then sternly Indra spake: “He is unclean,</div>

      <div class='line'>The Krodhavasha’s hand destroys the fruits</div>
      <div class='line'>Of sacrifice, if dogs defile the fire.</div>

      <div class='line'>That which is seemly is not hard of heart.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Still he replied: “’Tis written that to spurn</div>
      <div class='line'>A suppliant equals in offence to slay</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>A twice-born; wherefore, not for Swarga’s bliss</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Stay’st thou for this, who didst not stay for them—</div>
      <div class='line'>Draupadi, Bhima?”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>But the king yet spake:</div>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis known that none can hurt or help the dead.</div>
      <div class='line'>They, the delightful ones, who sank and died,</div>

      <div class='line'>Though I had turned, therefore I did not turn;</div>
      <div class='line'>But could help profit, I had turned to help.</div>
      <div class='line'>There be four sins, O Sakra, grievous sins:</div>
      <div class='line'>The first is making suppliants despair,</div>
      <div class='line'>The second is to slay a nursing wife,</div>

      <div class='line'>The fourth is injuring an ancient friend.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>These four I deem but equal to one sin,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Straight as he spake, brightly great Indra smiled;</div>

<p class='c004'>As a farmer and butter-maker I
want to condense a dissertation on
The Intellectual Cow, taken from the
London Spectator:</p>

<p class='c004'>The writer resents the general impression
that the cow is merely a food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>machine, and proves that she never
yet has had justice done to her mental
qualities, and is entitled to more
respectful consideration.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cows certainly possess decided individuality,
and in every herd will
be found a master mind which leads
and domineers over the rest or acts
as ringleader in mischief. They soon
learn their own names, and will answer
to them, and seldom make mistakes
as to their own stalls. They are
also undoubtedly influenced by affection,
and will give down milk more
freely to a friend than to one who is
brutal in his manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moreover, they enjoy petting just
as much as humans, and will greet
with delight those who bring offerings
of potatoes or apple-parings or
bits of bread, or who will give their
heads and necks the luxury of a good
rub.</p>

<p class='c004'>Charles Dudley Warner, in Being
a Boy, pays a glowing tribute to the
Martial Turkey:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps it is not generally known
that we get the idea of some of our
best military manœuvres from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>turkey. The deploying of the skirmish
line in advance of an army is
one of them. The drum major of our
holiday militia companies is copied
exactly from the turkey gobbler: he
has the same splendid appearance, the
same proud step, and the same martial
aspect. The gobbler does not lead his
forces in the field, but goes behind them,
like the colonel of a regiment, so that
he can see every part of the line and direct
its movements. This resemblance
is one of the most singular things in
natural history. I like to watch the
gobbler manœuvring his forces in a
grasshopper field. He throws out his
company of two dozen turkeys in a crescent-shaped
skirmish line, the number
disposed at equal distances, while he
walks majestically in the rear. They
advance rapidly, picking right and left,
with military precision, killing the foe
and disposing of the dead bodies with
the same peck. Nobody has yet discovered
how many grasshoppers a
turkey will hold; but he is very much
like a boy at a Thanksgiving dinner—he
keeps on eating as long as the supplies
last. The gobbler, in one of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>raids, does not condescend to grab a
single grasshopper—at least, not while
anybody is watching him. But I suppose
he makes up for it when his dignity
can not be injured by having spectators
of his voracity; perhaps he falls
upon the grasshoppers when they are
driven into a corner of the field. But
he is only fattening himself for destruction;
like all greedy persons, he
comes to a bad end. And if the turkeys
had any Sunday school, they
would be taught this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Josh Billings, in his Animile Statistix,
proved that he had been a close
observer. He says in this comical
medley:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Kats are affectionate, they luv
young chickens, sweet kream, and the
best place in front of the fireplace.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dogs are faithful; they will stick
to a bone after everybody haz deserted
it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The ox knoweth hiz master’s krib,
and that iz all he duz kno or care about
hiz master.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Munkeys are imitatiff, but if they
kan’t imitate some deviltry they ain’t
happy.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“The goose is like all other phools—alwuss
seems anxious to prove it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ducks are only cunning about one
thing: they lay their eggs in sitch sly
places that sumtimes they kan’t find
them again themselfs.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The mushrat kan foresee a hard
winter and provide for it, but he
kan’t keep from gittin ketched in the
sylliest kind ov a trap.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hens know when it is a going to
rain, and shelter themselfs, but they
will try to hatch out a glass egg just
az honest az they will one ov their

<p class='c004'>“The cuckcoo iz the greatest ekonemist
among the birds, she lays her eggs
in other birds’ nests, and lets them hatch
them out at their leizure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rats hav fewer friends and more
enemies than anything ov the four-legged
purswashun on the face ov
the earth, and yet rats are az plenty
now az in the palmyest days ov the
Roman Empire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The horse alwuss gits up from the
ground on his fore legs first, the kow
on her hind ones, and the dog turns
round 3 times before he lies down.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“The kangaroo he jumps when he
walks, the coon paces when he trots,

<p class='c004'>“The elephant has the least, and the
rabbit the most eye for their size, and
a rat’s tale is just the length ov hiz
boddy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The very latest item of interest to
dog-lovers is the announcement that
Bismarck has purchased a two-pound
King Charles spaniel from the dog
show in Boston.</p>

<p class='c004'>My collection is now as complete
as the limitations of time and the publishers
will allow. As proprietor, I
beg leave to announce my Literary
Zoo as now open at all hours (for a
moderate fee) to those interested in

ignorance, the inferior orders of

    <div>TWO REMARKABLE AMERICAN NOVELS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'><cite>THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE. An Episode of
the American Civil War.</cite> By <span class='sc'>Stephen Crane</span>. 12mo.
Cloth, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Stephen Crane is a great artist, with something new to say, and
consequently with a new way of saying it.... In ‘The Red Badge of
Courage’ Mr. Crane has surely contrived a masterpiece.... He has
painted a picture that challenges comparison with the most vivid scenes
of Tolstoy’s ‘La Guerre et la Paix’ or of Zola’s ‘La Débácle.’”—<cite>London
New Review.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“In its whole range of literature we can call to mind nothing so searching
in its analysis, so manifestly impressed with the stamp of truth, as ‘The
Red Badge of Courage.’... A remarkable study of the average mind
under stress of battle.... We repeat, a really fine achievement.”—<cite>London
Daily Chronicle.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Not merely a remarkable book: it is a revelation.... One feels that,
with perhaps one or two exceptions, all previous descriptions of modern
warfare have been the merest abstractions.”—<cite>St. James Gazette.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Holds one irrevocably. There is no possibility of resistance when
once you are in its grip, from the first of the march of the troops to the
closing scenes.... Mr. Crane, we repeat, has written a remarkable book.
His insight and his power of realization amount to genius.”—<cite>Pall Mall
Gazette.</cite></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'><cite>IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING. A Romance of the
American Revolution.</cite> By <span class='sc'>Chauncey C. Hotchkiss</span>.
12mo. Paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The whole story is so completely absorbing that you will sit far into
the night to finish it. You lay it aside with the feeling that you have seen
a gloriously true picture of the Revolution.”—<cite>Boston Herald.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The story is a strong one—a thrilling one. It causes the true American
to flush with excitement, to devour chapter after chapter until the eyes
smart; and it fairly smokes with patriotism.”—<cite>N. Y. Mail and Express.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The heart beats quickly, and we feel ourselves taking part in the
scenes described.... Altogether the book is an addition to American
literature.”—<cite>Chicago Evening Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“One of the most readable novels of the year.... As a love romance
it is charming, while it is filled with thrilling adventure and deeds of patriotic
daring.”—<cite>Boston Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“This romance seems to come the nearest to a satisfactory treatment
in fiction of the Revolutionary period that we have yet had.”—<cite>Buffalo
Courier.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“A clean, wholesome story, full of romance and interesting adventure....
Holds the interest alike by the thread of the story and by the incidents....
A remarkably well-balanced and absorbing novel.”—<cite>Milwaukee
Journal.</cite></p>

    <div>GILBERT PARKER’S BEST BOOKS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'><cite>THE SEATS OF THE MIGHTY.</cite> Being the
Memoirs of Captain <span class='sc'>Robert Moray</span>, sometime an Officer
in the Virginia Regiment, and afterward of Amherst’s Regiment.
12mo. Cloth, illustrated, $1.50.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the time of his story Mr. Parker has chosen the most absorbing
period of the romantic eighteenth-century history of Quebec. The curtain
rises soon after General Braddock’s defeat in Virginia, and the hero, a prisoner
in Quebec, curiously entangled in the intrigues of La Pompadour,
becomes a part of a strange history, full of adventure and the stress of peril,
which culminates only after Wolfe’s victory over Montcalm. The material
offered by the life and history of old Quebec has never been utilized
for the purposes of fiction with the command of plot and incident, the mastery
of local color, and the splendid realization of dramatic situations shown
in this distinguished and moving romance. The illustrations preserve the
atmosphere of the text, for they present the famous buildings, gates, and
battle-grounds as they appeared at the time of the hero’s imprisonment in
Quebec.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'><cite>THE TRAIL OF THE SWORD.</cite> A Novel. l2mo.
Paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Parker here adds to a reputation already wide, and anew demonstrates
his power of pictorial portrayal and of strong dramatic situation and
climax.”—<cite>Philadelphia Bulletin.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“The tale holds the reader’s interest from first to last, for it is full of
fire and spirit, abounding in incident, and marked by good character-drawing.”—<cite>Pittsburg
Times.</cite></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'><cite>THE TRESPASSER.</cite> 12mo. Paper, 50 cents; cloth,
$1.00.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Interest, pith, force, and charm—Mr. Parker’s new story possesses all
these qualities.... Almost bare of synthetical decoration, his paragraphs
are stirring because they are real. We read at times—as we have read the
great masters of romance—breathlessly.”—<cite>The Critic.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“Gilbert Parker writes a strong novel, but thus far this is his masterpiece....
It is one of the great novels of the year.”—<cite>Boston Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'><cite>THE TRANSLATION OF A SAVAGE.</cite> 16mo.
Flexible cloth, 75 cents.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A book which no one will be satisfied to put down until the end has
been matter of certainty and assurance.”—<cite>The Nation.</cite></p>

<p class='c019'>“A story of remarkable interest, originality, and ingenuity of construction.”—<cite>Boston
Home Journal.</cite></p>
